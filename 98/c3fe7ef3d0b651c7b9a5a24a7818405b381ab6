Is it possible to refactor the deprecated TableHelper to make it use a Table internally ? this would avoid maintaining the logic twice until 3.0

@stof PR is complete now.

@fabpot is it possible to fix fabbot so that it does not try to trim trailing whitespaces inside strings, or is it based on regexes like PHP-CS-Fixer ?

@stof fabbot.io is using PHP-CS-Fixer.

hmm, too bad then.
The PHP-CS-Fixer for Symfony will need to be adapted to avoid trimming trailing whitespaces on the TableTest.php file to avoid breaking the test by mistake.

anyway, it is a :+1: from me.
