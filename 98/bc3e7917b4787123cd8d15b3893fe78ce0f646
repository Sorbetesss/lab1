Doing many commits for now, in case some of them cannot be merged. Will squash if everything is all good.

Prepended the commit list with one cs-fix commit (self accessor), apparently the code wasn't even valid before any changes. Got rid of the fabbot commit by dispatching changes to the right commits.

The Travis failure seems unrelated.

The build failures are unrelated, please review again @nicolas-grekas

rebase needed please, but before, I'd recommend you to squash+apply move to short arrays.

I pushed a 2nd commit here, that uses an internal instance instead of static properties to track the state.
I also gave up preserving original ordering :)
