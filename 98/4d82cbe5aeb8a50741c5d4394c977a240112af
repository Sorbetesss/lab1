NB, preincrementation is about 30% faster in most cases, and this pull is only changing those cases where the behaviour of the code is unchanged to using preincrementation.

:+1: from me. :)

$i += $i is faster still if we really want to get into micro optimisations.

@trq for me it is more important to standardize code style.

why is the build failing on PHP 5.3.3?

@GrahamCampbell when you enable OPCache optimizations, it already optimizes the pre/post incrementation automatically AFAIK

Nice. :)

~~I think I'd be :-1: on this one.~~ It's not a hard stand, but I also see no added value here (the perf is not relevant), and I see downsides (readability and making merges harder)

It is always good to write it same way in whole project.
:+1: for standarization

@keradus What if we were to standardise postincrementation?

Only `++$i` or only `$i++` is fine with me.
But first one is faster - and not all envs has Zend's OPCache
