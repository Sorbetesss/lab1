thx @Simperfit to have taken a look at this. there’s still something odd.

I’m not sure the default value passed to the question should be its key, the doc comment says `@param mixed  $default  The default answer to return` so maybe the problem is instead that SymfonyStyle is converting the default value to its key

ps: but to be fair, that’s what [the documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/helpers/questionhelper.html#let-the-user-choose-from-a-list-of-answers) is doing

@mathroc SymfonyStyle is transforming this array. So it has value -> key. This fixes both behaviour when passing the key or the value look at the reproducer i've done to be sure that nothing will be broken : https://github.com/Simperfit/symfony-reproducer/commit/b37a2a5ddfd3a04540d8c93f9e8d810ef7c519cb

Travis failure is unrelated
