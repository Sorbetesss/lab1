@nicolas-grekas This is basically the same as #12963.

I just cherry-picked your fix so that the combinaison of both fixes have a chance to make tests green

@nicolas-grekas Thanks, though that was not really necessary since you fixed it in the same way. I closed #12963 in the meantime.

The question remains if we should also allow `~1.0` and `~2.0` for the proxy manager. Both releases don't break tests. What do you think?

Just added ~1.0 (but not 2.0 since it's a dev branch)
