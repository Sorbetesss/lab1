Actually, I think that the AssetsHelper should be updated to use the new system in 2.8 already

@stof Are you refering to the Asset component? Already in 2.8 we use the Asset component in the `AssetsHelper` and we provide a BC layer to keep the old behaviour. (see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Templating/Helper/AssetsHelper.php)

I just stumbled upon this issue, getting a `PHP Fatal error: Class 'Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Templating\Helper\AssetsHelper' not found` when using PHP templating.

As mentioned in the PR description, according to the upgrade guides, the `templating.helper.assets` service was removed in 3.0. Instead of adding back the `AssetsHelper` class, shouldn't the service definition be removed?

The UPGRADE file is wrong, in 3.0 the helper should provide integration with the Asset component.

I just reviewed this PR and everything is fine, IMHO. Thanks for fixing this @dosten.

I'm also creating a PR to fix the upgrade guides since those need to be fixed in 2.7.
