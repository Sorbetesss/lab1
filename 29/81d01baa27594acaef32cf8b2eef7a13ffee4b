@mvar can you work on finishing this ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mvar at 2015-01-04T12:46:33Z

@stof, yes I can. I will finish this PR on Monday or Tuesday.

I will remove previously mentioned `&nbsp;`. I think all spacing should be done using CSS.

Space issue on label attributes is already fixed: 90b3f3b0402deaa8709832d6f7cd3f53d31fb64b

So this PR will only remove whitespace (including `&nbsp;`) and add tests.

@mvar Is it ready to be merged?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mvar at 2015-02-11T12:53:40Z

@fabpot Yes, it is ready from my side. Should be reviewed first.

I will review it ASAP. In the meantime @mvar could you rebase please ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mvar at 2015-03-24T17:45:40Z

@lyrixx, rebased.

One more time I want to remember, that this PR removes hardcoded spaces (e.g., after checkbox before label text). Because such spaces cannot be easily controlled with CSS. This requires user to write some lines of CSS for custom spacing. I'm not sure all users will be happy about that.

@mvar Apparently, tests are broken.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mvar at 2015-03-25T10:21:06Z

@fabpot, fixed.
