Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

I would say that this makes sense (but it indeed needs tests covering it)

OK added tests to cover the new functionality and fixed existing ones 👍🏻
