I can't find a way to fix failing tests after applying this patch. Can you explain the use case of the failing tests which result of this PR?

The failing tests in AbstractLayoutTest were intended to test the output escaping of the values. Now that you added strict validation of the values, you can change the test to pass numbers instead of strings.
