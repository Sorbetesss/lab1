Maybe we should introduced the method firstly and then deprecate the get and remove the usage, because like this it would be hard to do both in the same PR. cc @ro0NL

I'm against deprecating `get()`. It's one a those function used a lot. We can deprecate the second argument and create a new method for getting all values though.

So getValue becames get and we keep getValues.
I think it's ok too because get is used everywhere in the code base and in project too.

To be honest, I would prefer to not change anything :)

I'd like some other opinion here @symfony/deciders

I'm for keeping get() and make it always return a string (ie deprecate argument `$first`) and adding `getAll($key): array `

Same opinion as @nicolas-grekas

I also think we should give `set` the same treatment as `get` to be consistent and make it use real types.
- create a `setValues` method
- only accept string in `set`, i.e. trigger a deprecation for anything but string. this would also solve the `int` problem in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/32122#discussion_r296465733

I'm for closing this PR and the related issue: we have enough open PR and this one provides very little benefit. We're just making everyone loose their time, @simperfit first (thank you btw!)

I think this is really important for usability and I'm highly in favor of merging it.
