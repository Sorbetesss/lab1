It can break Silex. I know, it's not maintained anymore, but that's just an example.
Why is it broken now in 3.4? Anything we should revert instead?

The `twig` service dependency is there from the begining. Looks like it never worked without TwigBundle installed.

`silexphp/Silex-WebProfiler` requires `"symfony/twig-bundle": "^2.8|^3.0"` what is the conflict with this? ðŸ¤”
