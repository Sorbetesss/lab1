Did you try with 3.4?

@nicolas-grekas the bug only appears with the classes which extend from `AbstractTagAwareAdapter` like FilesystemTagAwareAdapter which do not exist in 3.4 only in 4.3 . The `new TagAwareAdapter(new FileSystemAdapter));` which exist before does not contain this behaviour.

I pushed the fix on your fork. Redis adapters don't have the bug. The transient failures related to them are due to expirations being time-sensitive.
FilesystemTagAwareAdapter is the one that needed a fix.

@nicolas-grekas looks good. Thank you for having a look at this üëç. Travis error seems to have nothing todo with the changes in this PR.
