I tried something similar with `form.root` (#20369). I agree a twig solution for this is much better IMHO :+1:

But is a new feature :)

Should we add a method to _get_ the root from, along with the test.

@ro0NL I don't think so :) this fix a bug that affects all previous versions.

This is a new feature that will be great to have, a lot of third-party bundle check for `form.parent.vars` incurring the same problem.
