Maybe we can turn this into an issue form rather than a markdown template, which allows us to put more visible help texts on each field (and mark some as required), instead of having HTML comments in the markdown.

@stof Done, not sure if we need to keep both the md and the yaml files.

@fabpot no. GitHub will ignore the md file if it has a yaml template for the same name

shouldn't this be done in the 4.4 branch ? IIRC, we have managed those templates in the oldest maintained branch and merged them up until now (including the recent change done by @nicolas-grekas)

Rebased on 4.4, where the md files do not exist.
For some reasons, they exist on 5.3, they are removed here #44420
