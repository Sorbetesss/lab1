@jaugustin wouldn't this be picked up by the error handler form the Debug component?

@jakzal Yes that was the goal, and I just tested it now ;)

I mean, Debug component should pick up this kind of error even if you don't throw an exception (and it  should propose how to fix the class name).

@jakzal if you didn't set the `class` parameter the Debug component will tell you about a `Query` class not found but that didn't make much sens
