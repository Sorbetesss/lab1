TaggedIterator and TaggedLocator attributes are they still use full?

@KerianMM that's an open question. I see no hurry in deprecating them, I'd be fine waiting for 7.1.

Why not improving the existing attributes instead of adding new ones ?

Because I think it's important to push the `Autowire*` convention. It helps discovering/remembering those autowiring-related attributes.

👍 to do it on 7.1 and give time to people having them since 5.3. The docs should probably recommend the new ones asap though

> Last but not least, this adds support for nesting SubscribedService objects in the list of described services. This provides feature-parity with what we can do when implementing ServiceSubscriberInterface.

Can you add a code example please? Thanks
