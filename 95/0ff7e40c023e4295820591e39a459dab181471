This comment should be removed in the 5.0 branch of Symfony, as the `base_js` file from TwigBundle got removed there.

I'm quite sure this bugfix should apply to older versions than master though.

Sorry I'm a little lost in the process of proposing a pull request.
I checked the maintained versions from the roadmap and :

* **3.4** is not applicable as it does not have event listener on '.sf-toolbar-ajax-clear'
* **4.4** is applicable to this patch
* **5.0 and 5.1**  are applicable to this patch but top comment should be removed as you suggested

Should I update the pull request branch to ">=4.4" ?

yeah, please submit this to 4.4 (and then check if the TwigBundle file needs the same patch).

Removing the top comment in 5.0 is not actually something related to your bugfix (it is related to what you wrote, though). This should probably be done as a separate PR against the branch.

Pull request target was updated to origin/4.4 and rebased onto it.
No references to `-clear` were found in the `TwigBundle/Resources/views/base_js.html.twig`.
