Can you add a test for this issue?

Question: `empty()` also filters out empty strings while `!isset()` doesn't. Is this relevant here?

Excellent PR. Thank you.

If you add a small test for this I'll be happy to merge.

I'm kinda waiting on a reply in the mentioned issue tbh.
Cause it's really only a bug in that specific usecase, which I'm not 100% sure should be valid anyways.

Sorry took me a while to get to it but I got some tests that would fail without the changes on both PRs

This applies to `4.4` too, right?

Yeah it's actually a thing in all symfony versions I think.
