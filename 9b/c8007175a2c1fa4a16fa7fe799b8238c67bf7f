That interface looks indeed useless since 7.1. @xabbuh can you have a look as you were the one making NameConverterInterface methods' signatures the same as the `AdvancedNameConverterInterface` in 7.1?
If this is what we want, we probably need to add `@param` phpdoc annotations to each method of `NameConverterInterface` for the new params, to leverage `DebugClassLoader`'s deprecation system.

@chalasr, the `@param` annotations are already on top of `NameConverterInterface` related methods.

Can you please rebase now that https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/58368 is merged to ensure tests keep passing despite an implementation exists in core?
