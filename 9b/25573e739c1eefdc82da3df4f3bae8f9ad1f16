I've rebased my PR on master to make Travis happy.

I'm not sure about this because translations will have different kinds of `id` depending on its contents:

```xml
<trans-unit id="http_error_403.suggestion"> ... </trans-unit>
<trans-unit id="ca41fec"> ... </trans-unit>
```

Why can't we just apply this md5 ID to all translation nodes? Why it's important to duplicate the translation contents in the `id` too? XLIFF is already verbose and this is not helping ðŸ˜“

As mentioned in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/25758

> For backward compatibility I don't expect to see a change to the way the <source> element is used, but for the 1.2 and 2.0 formats to be treated as equivalent it seems the same logic should be applied.

So we use `source` as `name` to be similar to 1.2.
