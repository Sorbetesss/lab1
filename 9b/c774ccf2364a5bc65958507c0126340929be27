I've done the fix in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/master...GuilhemN:debug-int, I did not realize it was there since 3.4...
BTW one of test cases should have detected this issue... If it wasn't broken itself ðŸ˜…

'@GuilhemN thanks a lot for having a look! Actually I don't agree with your patch, the test was fine and it's exactly why it was added in #28411. The issue is nastier: we don't deal with traits correctly. This very check you moved up shouldn't exist at all - and we should never inspect method annotations on traits.
This PR is now ready with the correct fix, see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/28553/files?w=1

Oops sorry, I thought I was the one who introduced it and by mistake ðŸ˜¶ I understand now why you've done this change, I will review your last commit asap :)
