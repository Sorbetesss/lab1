Why does this require a new interface? Can't a webpusher we implemented as a texter or a chatter like the other bridges?

No preference, just thought that it'd be better to separate web push transports from texter/chatter.

OK thanks. Then, unless there is a real reason that'd need to be discussed, this should be implemented as a transport really.

Hmm, but then if we don't introduce webpusher as a transport, all the texter or chatter transports would be injected to the web push channel. Is that okay?

What is the status on this PR.

Isn't this something @dunglas would be super interested to see?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am just waiting for reviews :)

=)

While waiting, could you do a rebase on this PR to the latest CI jobs will run?

@OskarStark I've renamed to webpush to push :)

Please make fabbot happy 😊

Not need before merging, but having a docs PR would be super helpful 👌🏻

I think I could add them later with a first provider integration for push :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2021-04-13T08:17:08Z

I think a first integration would be needed before merging. Right now, this looks quite abstract to me, and there are no tests... I'm also not really deep into the topic. /cc @fabpot I think this is for you :)

Preparing one :) there were no channel tests, but will add some for push message then

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by OskarStark at 2021-04-13T11:04:28Z

Lets add the first integration in this PR to proof the abstraction 👍

@norkunas good work :+1:  You have conflicting files :+1:

This is not surprising :) resolved conflicts

failures resolved :)

Not sure but if a "Push Channel" is introduced then it would make sense to move `symfony/firebase-notifier` from the "Chat Channel" (docs: https://symfony.com/doc/current/notifier.html#chat-channel) to the new "Push Channel" because it is not a chat but a service for push notifications?

Maybe this affects other chatters too, this I don't know.

I guess this would break backward compatibility.

I could try to make a PR for `symfony/firebase-notifier` if it is wanted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by OskarStark at 2021-09-25T07:20:12Z

Firebase Notifier can provide chat AND push functionality, while we can deprecate chat functionality in 5.4 and remove it in 6.0

From my POV we should merge this new channel

What's so special with this PR that nobody other wants to approve? :grin:
