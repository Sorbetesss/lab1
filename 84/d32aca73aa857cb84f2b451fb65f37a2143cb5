I just renamed test methods that were tied to methods that no longer exists (`isSelf()`, `isIndirect()`). I think we'll have to do without a review from @l-vo â€¦

@greg0ire Excuse me, I'm currently running out of time and I have to get back into the context. But I'm going to look at this as soon as I can ðŸ˜Š

I reviewed and tested the changes, it looks good to me. Although there is a problem, the tests don't pass. The changes on the type "self" determination makes the type "self" difficult to test.

@l-vo I applied your suggestions, please review again :)
Note that the patch from fabbot should not be applied as code in this particular component should still be compatible with php 5.5.9
