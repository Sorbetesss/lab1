In case you missed it, "AMP for mail" is now a reality. I'm not asking to add support for AMP ... but we should review that the current architecture doesn't prevent from adding AMP support in the future (in core or via extensions).

Specifically:

> Important things to note:
>
> The text/x-amp-html part must be nested under a multipart/alternative node, it will not be recognized by the email client otherwise.
>
> Some email clients will only render the last MIME part, so we recommend placing the text/x-amp-html MIME part before the text/html MIME part.

@fabpot

What is our plan when a provider deprecate an usage / remove it or change a default configuration ? Shouldn't there be a version system somewhere in the provider bridges ?

Also, what is the criteria for a provider to be in SF core ? I think it should be clear.

@javiereguiluz I've just read the AMP for email page and the good news is that we are compatible. One needs to add the AMP part "manually", but that's a great use case for using the low-level interface of the component. I don't think that AMP should be a first-class citizen of the component though.

Tests are green now.
