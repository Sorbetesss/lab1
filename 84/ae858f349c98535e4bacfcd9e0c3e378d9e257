The `supports-color` npm package has [2 different kind of checks] (https://github.com/chalk/supports-color/blob/d4f413efaf8da045c5ab440ed418ef02dbb28bf1/index.js#L153-L159) for `TERM`:

- whether it ends with `-256` or `-256color` (in which case it reports color support for what we call the Ansi8 mode)
- whether it starts with a bunch of prefixes (more than just `screen-` and `xterm-`)

Should we take the full list there ?

@theofidry for the diff, see the diff of your force-push: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/76e89cb21a56a42a95c0dbaf1b75438441ee4410..50b0051c78f853d605cbc57209e065b9a7a3e357

This was about removing the `\` qualifying the `preg_match` function name.
