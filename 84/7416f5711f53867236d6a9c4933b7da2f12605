I forgot to mention, without the IDE integration enabled, the link will link to a page showing the source code of the twig file within the profiler view (like it does with the controller) another cool feature we gain here is the quick ability to get from the rendered view, to viewing the twig source code (when IDE Integration is not enabled)
