@nicolas-grekas Is there any reason for adding this to the 3.x milestone but https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21375 to the 3.3 one? They are about fixing the same ticket so if there is something wrong to you here, please tell me :)

Updated this to make the serializer id and encoder/normalizer tags configurable through the constructor, defaulting to the ones used in the framework.

But, isn't a BC break to add a parent class with a new constructor to the deprecated pass?
Edit: according to the BC promise:

> Add constructor without mandatory arguments: Yes [1]
[1] Should be avoided. When done, this change must be documented in the UPGRADE file.

I guess it's fine here.

Do we want to move forward on this for 3.3? It would be nice to have a thought, to know if it's worth working on other relevant passes listed in the ticket using the same approach.

IMO it makes sense to move them.
