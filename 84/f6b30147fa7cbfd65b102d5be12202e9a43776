So, no more trick to run only the skipped tests with ini-max ?

The skipped persistence is still there, triggered by the SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_SKIPPED_TESTS env var.
But appveyor kills the build on the first failing line, which is annoying. I'm going to fix that now

Ready, should also reduce test transiency
