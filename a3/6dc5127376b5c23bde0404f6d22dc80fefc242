Instead of doing this change, would adding the `@after` annotation on `ensureKernelShutdown` work?

@nicolas-grekas sounds like a good idea! Did change it.

@nicolas-grekas tried it but __call seems never be called when parent::tearDown() is called it seems directly calling the PhpUnit teardown. (https://wtools.io/php-sandbox/6y)

@nicolas-grekas and the `@after` seems to be called after the `tearDown` so there should be no problems if the kernel is still needed in the tearDown.
