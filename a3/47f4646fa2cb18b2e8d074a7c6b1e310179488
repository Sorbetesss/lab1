@fabpot, @nicolas-grekas; should we consider valid a locale including variants? "it_IT_NEDIS_ROJAZ_1901" by instance: http://php.net/manual/en/locale.getallvariants.php

> should we consider valid a locale including variants?

Only if a real world app needs it. Let's not spend time on theoretical improvements.

I can't imagine a practical use case using variants right now, but I think we should left a note about the situation in docs, explaining that locales including variants will not be considered valid. WDYT?

Do you know how we could avoid having different results per platform? AppVeyor is reading "en-us.utf8@VARIANT" as a valid locale, while in Travis it is invalid. Shouldn't both environments be using the same bundled ICU data?

let's make the test case independent from the data version instead, we're not testing the data set here.
