I was wondering is we should make the `Groups` attribute variadic. Instead of…
```php
#[Groups(['list', 'detail'])]
```
… we could then write…
```php
#[Groups('list', 'detail')]
```
This would look a bit nicer, but adding additional properties in the future would get messy.

@derrabus Can you have a look at the failing tests?

I used `::class` in annotations, but Doctrine Annotations 1.0 does not support that. Should be fixed now.
