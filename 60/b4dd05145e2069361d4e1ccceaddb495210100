I need to further tell that without this change ldap is almost unusable in some cases.

For example, to build a tree of departments, you need to search in SCOPE_ONELEVEL but you can't (without this PR).

My dirty workaround is to look at length of entry's dn to understand if this is sub-department (cn is uuid, so it has fixed size). This is very dirty and unreliable solution.

Why does nobody look at this PR (it's week already)? @csarrazi marked as author in https://github.com/symfony/ldap. Should I contact him?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@xunto I do not receive notifications unless I am explicitly tagged in a comment.

One thing though, please also add functional tests for the scope handling.

I apologise for big amount of commits. My distro have different paths for openldap so I can't run tests on my computer.

@xunto No problem, as long as you squash everything later! ;)

You could also use the [csarrazi/symfony-ldap](https://hub.docker.com/r/csarrazi/symfony-ldap/) docker repository, if you want to easily spawn an openldap instance, btw!

@csarrazi Everything should be ok now. Thanks for review. I going to squash it right now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by csarrazi at 2016-11-02T13:38:12Z

You're welcome!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xunto at 2016-11-02T14:27:50Z

@csarrazi Everything is done. Tests pass.

@csarrazi Should I slap deciders or mergers now?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by csarrazi at 2016-11-03T08:51:36Z

Yup! :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xunto at 2016-11-03T09:04:57Z

@csarrazi Thanks for help! @symfony/deciders, it's your turn!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-11-03T15:19:17Z

Just for your information, this new feature won't be merged for 3.2, but considered for 3.3.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xunto at 2016-11-03T16:14:36Z

@fabpot Sad but ok, I think.

So it won't get into the master until 3.2 is released? So, in december.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-11-03T16:20:14Z

Right, that's correct.

Hey @xunto! Sorry for getting back one more time. Could you just amend your PR and change the scope names so they respect RFC 2255? ("base" / "one" / "sub").

See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2255

> The scope construct is used to specify the scope of the search to
>    perform in the given LDAP server.  The allowable scopes are "base"
>    for a base object search, "one" for a one-level search, or "sub" for
>    a subtree search.  If scope is omitted, a scope of "base" is assumed.

That would be great! :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xunto at 2016-11-14T02:09:28Z

@csarrazi Ok, will do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xunto at 2016-11-15T13:33:57Z

@csarrazi done.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xunto at 2016-12-02T06:34:28Z

@symfony/deciders, 3.2 is released. Looks like now we can merge this.
