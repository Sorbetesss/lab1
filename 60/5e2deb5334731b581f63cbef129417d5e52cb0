Should be for master as it's not a trivial change as proved by the comments (and not a bug fix either).

the remaining changes are equivalent at least :) in this case avoiding the foreach in lower branches is nice? I.e. if one patches it we need to switch back to foreach upstream as well =/

@fabpot, targeting master sounds good to me.

@ro0NL, the syntax is not supported by PHP prior to 7.0, so only 4.1 and master can be targeted. Later merging can require re-introducing foreach, theoretically.
