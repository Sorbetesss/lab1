The last two examples on [this page ](https://github.com/alexislefebvre/SymfonyWorkflowStyleBundle/blob/1bcdf4f22741988b24ac07b2ea0f010273849fe7/README.md#examples) shows the dot format, with `multiple_state`, transitions are displayed as square instead of arrows with texts.

So the option `background_color` is used instead of `arrow_color` because it's meaningless in this context. I still have to find a limited number of parameters that would allow styling states and transitions with state machines and workflows.

Can someone please remove the `Deprecation` tag? I forgot to change the value when creating the PR.

rebase needed due to short arrays.

Thanks @alexislefebvre . This is very Good. Could you rebase before the merge ? (I think this will conflict with #30468 but I will take care of it).

Could someone review English textes (PHP Doc, Changelog)? :pray: Thanks

Rebase done. :heavy_check_mark:

Thanks for the follow-up.
