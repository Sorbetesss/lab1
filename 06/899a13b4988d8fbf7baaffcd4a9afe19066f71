There is a `to be removed in 5.0` on this method:
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/81241590520ce8338777072b6bdcc8600a00cbda/src/Symfony/Component/Form/FormConfigBuilder.php#L775-L777

What's the planned alternative for this case?

The plan was to make the method private.

@Tobion but it's used out there (`ButtonBuilder`):

Tests (low) are broken.

Mmm, I'm not sure why, the broken tests are being eliminated here :thinking:
