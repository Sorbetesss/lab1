@GromNaN I revamped the PR with the feedback that was given in the other one and by taking into account your review on this one :slightly_smiling_face:

@javiereguiluz Thanks, I agree with every point! I updated the PR accordingly. I understand how challenging this kind of PR it is, we don't have that much "space" to explain things like in the doc :smile:
