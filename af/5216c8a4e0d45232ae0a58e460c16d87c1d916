Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

There seem to be some code style issues but fabbot.io doesn't say what they are.

I accidentally set "deprecations" to yes instead of no so carsonbot marked this PR as such, sorry.

Dries, we removed the `deprecation` label. Thanks for telling us.

Unsure why the AppVeyor build is failing. I can't see any failing tests but it's a little hard to digest with all the separate runs for the different components.

@driesvints as I can see, this is related to maximum build time exceeded (20 minutes) - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fabpot/symfony/builds/40692324/messages

I think this fail should be skipped
