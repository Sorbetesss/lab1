Would setting a branch alias on the notifier package help?

@derrabus Probably, but I'll let @nicolas-grekas confirm it's desirable.
Anyway, do we really want to forbid `5.4.x` and later?

How does composer behave if we use the `branch-version` entry to say this is 5.3.x-dev?

@nicolas-grekas Tried using `"branch-version": "5.3.x"`, first on the root's composer.json then on the Notifier's root one. Either way, it didn't help (any chance we need to merge that entry first to see the result actually?)
