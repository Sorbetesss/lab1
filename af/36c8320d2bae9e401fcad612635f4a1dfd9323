Not sure how or if BC should be handled here, any opinions?

I'll rework this and create a new proposal :)

@iltar please have a look at it again.
I've reverted all changes not needed, especially the visibility changes to the methods.
This PR uses reflection to gain access to the streams. It is now also free from BC breaks.

Ping @nicolas-grekas, sorry for pinging you from a PR you are not involved in so far, hope it is OK.
I would like to move forward on a fix for this issue, one way or another. Please let me know if I'm on the right track. Than I know how I could make a temp. fix over at PHP-CS-Fixer (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1654) while this PR @ SF is being processed.
