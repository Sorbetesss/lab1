Please note that you need squash your commits before this PR can be merged. The maintainer can also squash the commits for you, but then you need to “Allow edits from maintainer” (there is a checkbox in the sidebar of the PR).

Cheers!

@stof I've addressed all your comments. I've added a test for the `delete` method of the Provider (I'll do the same for other providers).
@OskarStark I've rebased the branch on 5.x, and removed the `SCHEME` constant from the Provider Factory.

It looks ready for another review.

EDIT: CI failings seems unrelated
