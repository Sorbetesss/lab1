This eases reusability and extensibility

What about injecting the `translationNodeVisitor` instance in the constructor (as an optional argument of course)?

Yeah I also think about this option (and want your opinion about that).
The purpose is to be able to override the translationNodeVisitor without must rewrite everything so it's +1 for me.

I make the change accordingly.
