this is not good, as it looses the debugging info.It might be better to wrap it in a FatalThrowableError to be able to continue the flattening

I'm fine with that if you want me to make that change. I just thought you'd want to separate that behaviour from that class, so I went with skipping.

How does this look then?

:+1:
And if you manage to add a test case I would be +2 :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-18T17:19:30Z

I'll add a couple of tests in a few hours.

Status: needs work

Sorry, I'll get to this soon. ;)

Ping @nicolas-grekas. Not sure what's going on with travis. Looks like it couldn't be arsed to run the tests for some reason?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-22T12:17:17Z

Yeh, PHP 5.4 and 5.5 are running no tests for some reason. :/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This travis issue is affecting the entire code base. For example, one of your PRs didn't get the tests run: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17104.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2015-12-22T12:24:22Z

5.4 and 5.5 are skipped for PRs so that we get more slots on travis

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-22T12:24:55Z

Ah, right, so it was intentional. That makes sense. I was just worried that they were getting silently skipped. ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-22T12:25:46Z

They still waste about 50 seconds of time though each. :(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2015-12-22T12:31:25Z

Yep... I found no way to be quicker, the slow part is apt-get, which can't be skipped AFAIK

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-22T13:10:25Z

Test passing now btw. ;)

Is this good to merge then? I'm just concious that new symfony releases normally happen around a month after the previous ones, and I'd quite like to have this fix included in the next set of releases.

BTW, Happy Christmas everyone. :christmas_tree:
