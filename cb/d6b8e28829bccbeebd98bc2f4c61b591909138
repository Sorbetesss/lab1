It should be just deprecated, the implementation doesn't fit any generic use case - and we now have real env vars.

Do you propose to soft deprecate it in 3.4? Core would still use it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sounds good yes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2017-09-01T18:39:20Z

Done.

Can you add an entry in UPGRADE-4.0 about the removal?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2017-09-01T19:34:27Z

If this goes first, i can do that in #24067. Along with the actual removal :)

edit: or do we care about the state of UPGRADE-4.0 in 3.4?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by chalasr at 2017-09-01T19:35:55Z

I'd say no, just to not forgot about it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2017-09-01T19:39:25Z

Which raises the question; do we need that file in 3.4 anyway? If you should follow the master version

I would update the 4.0 UPGRADE file in this PR, that's what we've been doing for years :)

@ro0NL If the author doesn't do the removing PR (or if we remove while merging up) it's good to have this file already up to date.

> it's good to have this file already up to date.

Yeah but without the actual code change it's technically not true (yet) :) I see the POV, and as long as lowest branch is leading there's no real issue. Just wanted to point out it can be fragile, and maintaining a single version of truth might make sense :)

@fabpot it already went wrong :) https://www.diffchecker.com/vQeHcX37

basically the same file is out of sync between branches.

Updated anyway :)
