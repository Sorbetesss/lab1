What do you think about to move the code to `convertController()` method to cover `bin/console debug:router` too (i.e. without `name` argument) ?

@yceruto I did it at the first attempt, but the output was really ugly :/

@yceruto Thanks for the review. I have addressed your comments.

Actually, I would like to propose a new approach for this comment. Instead of displaying:
```
| Defaults     | _controller: AppBundle:Default:index                    |
```
Could we display:
```
| Defaults     | _controller: AppBundle:Default:index                              |
                      (class: AppBundle\Controller\DefaultController::indexAction) |
```

What about removing the parentheses?

This implementation has a drawback: it instantiate the controller (and of its dependencies).
could we use the dumped ContainerBuilder (used by ``debug:container``) to look at the service definition instead (and skipping this enhanced behavior when we don't have this dumped ContainerBuilder) ?

@stof I think using the "dev" container is not a good idea, because some route could only exist in production, and it will became hard to debug. Thus, here we only instantiate **one** controller (and yes all deps). IMHO It's not a big deal.

I update the code to always display the class name (`a:b:c` or `service:method` notation).
And I updated the screenshot.

I think this PR is ready
