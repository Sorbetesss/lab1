Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "5.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.4".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

> That's for 5.4, no?

That's not necessary for `doctrine/mongodb-odm-bundle` since the bug is in a version that requires 6.4+.
