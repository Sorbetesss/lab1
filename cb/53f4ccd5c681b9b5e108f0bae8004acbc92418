I don't like adding a new config option for this not-so-important feature. What if we set a non-configurable and common sense limit (e.g. `100` requests) and when you get MAX + 1 requests, the first one is dropped and so on.

I like idea about cutting off oldest requests, rather than stopping flow of new ones

@javiereguiluz I guess it makes more sens.

@ostrolucky Yes, why not I didn't think of that in the first place but it could be nice too.

@javiereguiluz so even if it's not the requested feature, is it really worth it to add this non-configurable limit ? I guess we could let it configurable, it make sense to me too WDYT ?

Please, don't make it configurable. It does not make sense.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So we agree for a limit like 100 requests, after that we drop the olds one to have the new one ?

LGTM

@fabpot @javiereguiluz @ostrolucky could you please review this one ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2018-02-16T09:03:15Z

It looks good to me. The current patch looks like a bug fix now. So, I would merge it into 2.7 instead of master. WDYT?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Simperfit at 2018-02-16T10:16:52Z

I agree, let's look on what other are thinking and ill rebase it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2018-02-19T07:31:33Z

I think you can go ahead and rebase on 2.7.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Simperfit at 2018-02-19T14:39:44Z

rebased.
