Hey!

I think @TimoBakx has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Thanks for the PR.
As it's too late for 6.2, this PR should be rebased on the 6.3 branch (and the changelog entry be moved accordingly) once that branch is created, when 6.2.0 stable is released.

This looks wrong to me. Something else than the Firewall could still be using the session.

@stof Sure, but that's why you want a warning IMO. If the firewall is stateless then you *shouldn't* rely on the session and opening one will most likely result in data loss or at least inefficiencies in the code as it reads from session storage for nothing.
