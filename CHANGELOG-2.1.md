2.1.0
-----

### DoctrineBridge

 * added a default implementation of the ManagerRegistry
 * added a session storage for Doctrine DBAL
 * DoctrineOrmTypeGuesser now guesses "collection" for array Doctrine type

### TwigBridge

 * added a csrf_token function
 * added a way to specify a default domain for a Twig template (via the 'trans_default_domain' tag)

### AbstractDoctrineBundle

 * This bundle has been removed and the relevant code has been moved to the Doctrine bridge

### DoctrineBundle

 * This bundle has been moved to the Doctrine organization
 * added optional `group_by` property to `EntityType` that supports either a
   `PropertyPath` or a `\Closure` that is evaluated on the entity choices
 * The `em` option for the `UniqueEntity` constraint is now optional (and should
   probably not be used anymore).

### FrameworkBundle

 * changed the default extension for XLIFF files from .xliff to .xlf
 * moved Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\ContainerAwareEventDispatcher to Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\ContainerAwareEventDispatcher
 * moved Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Debug\TraceableEventDispatcher to Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\ContainerAwareTraceableEventDispatcher
 * added a router:match command
 * added a config:dump-reference command
 * added a server:run command
 * added kernel.event_subscriber tag
 * added a way to create relative symlinks when running assets:install command (--relative option)
 * added Controller::getUser()
 * [BC BREAK] assets_base_urls and base_urls merging strategy has changed
 * changed the default profiler storage to use the filesystem instead of SQLite
 * added support for placeholders in route defaults and requirements (replaced
   by the value set in the service container)
 * added Filesystem component as a dependency
 * added support for hinclude (use ``standalone: 'js'`` in render tag)
 * session options: lifetime, path, domain, secure, httponly were deprecated.
   Prefixed versions should now be used instead: cookie_lifetime, cookie_path,
   cookie_domain, cookie_secure, cookie_httponly
 * [BC BREAK] following session options: 'lifetime', 'path', 'domain', 'secure',
   'httponly' are now prefixed with cookie_ when dumped to the container
 * Added `handler_id` configuration under `session` key to represent `session.handler`
   service, defaults to `session.handler.native_file`.
 * Added `gc_maxlifetime`, `gc_probability`, and `gc_divisor` to session
   configuration. This means session garbage collection has a
  `gc_probability`/`gc_divisor` chance of being run. The `gc_maxlifetime` defines
   how long a session can idle for. It is different from cookie lifetime which
   declares how long a cookie can be stored on the remote client.


### MonologBundle

 * This bundle has been moved to its own repository (https://github.com/symfony/MonologBundle)

### SecurityBundle

 * [BC BREAK] The custom factories for the firewall configuration are now
   registered during the build method of bundles instead of being registered
   by the end-user (you need to remove the 'factories' keys in your security
   configuration).

 * [BC BREAK] The Firewall listener is now registered after the Router one. This
   means that specific Firewall URLs (like /login_check and /logout must now
   have proper route defined in your routing configuration)

 * [BC BREAK] refactored the user provider configuration. The configuration
   changed for the chain provider and the memory provider:

    Before:

    ``` yaml
    security:
        providers:
            my_chain_provider:
                providers: [my_memory_provider, my_doctrine_provider]
            my_memory_provider:
                users:
                    toto: { password: foobar, roles: [ROLE_USER] }
                    foo: { password: bar, roles: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN] }
    ```

    After:

    ``` yaml
    security:
        providers:
            my_chain_provider:
                chain:
                    providers: [my_memory_provider, my_doctrine_provider]
            my_memory_provider:
                memory:
                    users:
                        toto: { password: foobar, roles: [ROLE_USER] }
                        foo: { password: bar, roles: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN] }
    ```

 * [BC BREAK] Method `equals` was removed from `UserInterface` to its own new
   `EquatableInterface`. The user class can now implement this interface to override
   the default implementation of users equality test.

 * added a validator for the user password
 * added 'erase_credentials' as a configuration key (true by default)
 * added new events: `security.authentication.success` and `security.authentication.failure`
   fired on authentication success/failure, regardless of authentication method,
   events are defined in new event class: `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\AuthenticationEvents`.

 * Added optional CSRF protection to LogoutListener:

    ``` yaml
    security:
        firewalls:
            default:
                logout:
                    path: /logout_path
                    target: /
                    csrf_parameter: _csrf_token        # Optional (defaults to "_csrf_token")
                    csrf_provider:  form.csrf_provider # Required to enable protection
                    intention:      logout             # Optional (defaults to "logout")
    ```

    If the LogoutListener has CSRF protection enabled but cannot validate a token,
   then a LogoutException will be thrown.

 * Added `logout_url` templating helper and Twig extension, which may be used to
   generate logout URL's within templates. The security firewall's config key
   must be specified. If a firewall's logout listener has CSRF protection
   enabled, a token will be automatically added to the generated URL.

### SwiftmailerBundle

 * This bundle has been moved to its own repository (https://github.com/symfony/SwiftmailerBundle)
 * moved the data collector to the bridge
 * replaced MessageLogger class with the one from Swiftmailer 4.1.3

### TwigBundle

 * added the real template name when an error occurs in a Twig template
 * added the twig:lint command that will validate a Twig template syntax.

### WebProfilerBundle

 * [BC BREAK] You must clear old profiles after upgrading to 2.1 (don't forget to
   remove the table if you are using a DB)
 * added support for the request method
 * added a routing panel
 * added a timeline panel
 * The toolbar position can now be configured via the `position` option (can be `top` or `bottom`)

### Form

 * [BC BREAK] ``read_only`` field attribute now renders as ``readonly="readonly"``, use ``disabled`` instead
 * [BC BREAK] child forms now aren't validated anymore by default
 * made validation of form children configurable (new option: cascade_validation)
 * added support for validation groups as callbacks
 * made the translation catalogue configurable via the "translation_domain" option
 * added Form::getErrorsAsString() to help debugging forms
 * allowed setting different options for RepeatedType fields (like the label)
 * added support for empty form name at root level, this enables rendering forms
   without form name prefix in field names
 * [BC BREAK] form and field names must start with a letter, digit or underscore
   and only contain letters, digits, underscores, hyphens and colons
 * [BC BREAK] changed default name of the prototype in the "collection" type
   from "$$name$$" to "\__name\__". No dollars are appended/prepended to custom
   names anymore.
 * [BC BREAK] improved ChoiceListInterface
 * [BC BREAK] added SimpleChoiceList and LazyChoiceList as replacement of
   ArrayChoiceList
 * added ChoiceList and ObjectChoiceList to use objects as choices
 * [BC BREAK] removed EntitiesToArrayTransformer and EntityToIdTransformer.
   The former has been replaced by CollectionToArrayTransformer in combination
   with EntityChoiceList, the latter is not required in the core anymore.

 * [BC BREAK] renamed

   * ArrayToBooleanChoicesTransformer to ChoicesToBooleanArrayTransformer
   * ScalarToBooleanChoicesTransformer to ChoiceToBooleanArrayTransformer
   * ArrayToChoicesTransformer to ChoicesToValuesTransformer
   * ScalarToChoiceTransformer to ChoiceToValueTransformer

    to be consistent with the naming in ChoiceListInterface.

 * [BC BREAK] removed FormUtil::toArrayKey() and FormUtil::toArrayKeys().
   They were merged into ChoiceList and have no public equivalent anymore.
 * choice fields now throw a FormException if neither the "choices" nor the
   "choice_list" option is set
 * the radio type is now a child of the checkbox type
 * the collection, choice (with multiple selection) and entity (with multiple
   selection) types now make use of addXxx() and removeXxx() methods in your
   model if you set "by_reference" to false. For a custom, non-recognized
   singular form, set the "property_path" option like this: "plural|singular"
 * forms now don't create an empty object anymore if they are completely
   empty and not required. The empty value for such forms is null.
 * added constant Guess::VERY_HIGH_CONFIDENCE
 * [BC BREAK] FormType::getParent() does not see default options anymore
 * [BC BREAK] The methods `add`, `remove`, `setParent`, `bind` and `setData`
   in class Form now throw an exception if the form is already bound
 * fields of constrained classes without a NotBlank or NotNull constraint are
   set to not required now, as stated in the docs
 * fixed TimeType and DateTimeType to not display seconds when "widget" is
   "single_text" unless "with_seconds" is set to true
 * checkboxes of in an expanded multiple-choice field don't include the choice
   in their name anymore. Their names terminate with "[]" now.

   don't receive an options array anymore.
 * deprecated FormValidatorInterface and substituted its implementations
   by event subscribers
 * simplified CSRF protection and removed the csrf type

 * added method `guessPattern` to FormTypeGuesserInterface to guess which pattern to use in the HTML5 attribute "pattern"
 * deprecated method `guessMinLength` in favor of `guessPattern`

### Security

 * after login, the user is now redirected to `default_target_path` if `use_referer` is true and the referrer is the `login_path`.
 * added a way to remove a token from a session
 * [BC BREAK] changed `MutableAclInterface::setParentAcl` to accept `null`, review your implementation to reflect this change.
 * `ObjectIdentity::fromDomainObject`, `UserSecurityIdentity::fromAccount` and `UserSecurityIdentity::fromToken` now return
   correct identities for proxies objects (e.g. Doctrine proxies)

### Validator

 * added support for `ctype_*` assertions in `TypeValidator`
 * added a Size validator
 * added a SizeLength validator
 * improved the ImageValidator with min width, max width, min height, and max height constraints
