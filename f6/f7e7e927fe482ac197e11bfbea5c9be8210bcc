You need to update the XML schema definition too.

@xabbuh Thanks. I update the XML schema. Can you double check, I never did that before...

you are missing the usage of the type to define the element using it in the ``config`` type:

```xml
<xsd:element name="property-accessor" type="property_accessor" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" />
```

@stof  Done. But other block misses `minOccurs` and co ...

@lyrixx nope. The issue is that what you did is not what I asked for. the definition of the ``property_accessor`` complexType was right before. what was missing was the usage of this complexType to say that the ``config`` type (defined at the beginning of the XSD) can have a ``property-accessor`` child appearing 0 or 1 times and using this ``property_accessor`` type.

your current XSD is allowing to put ``property-accessor`` as a top-level element in the config, not as a child of ``<config>``, which is wrong.

@stof Thanks. It should be ok now. I just rename `property_accessor` to `property_access`. Is it ok now ?
