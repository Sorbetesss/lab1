some internal calls of `Process::updateStatus` may need an update after merging this in 2.3 (`Process::getPid`, probably some other)

Tests are failing because of another test suite than Process :

```
Symfony\Component\Config\Tests\Resource\DirectoryResourceTest::testIsFreshDeleteFile
->isFresh() returns false if an existing file is removed
Failed asserting that true is false.
```
