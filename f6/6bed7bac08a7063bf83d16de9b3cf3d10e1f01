should we write regression tests for these changes?

I'm not sure to understand what you envision @cordoval.
We could add a test for the DebugClassLoader::getClassLoader() method, but as it's implementation is trivial, I don't see the benefit. Can you elaborate and drive me to a patch please?

true we are not backporting this, and the test acknowledging this code is removed in future versions may not be needed
