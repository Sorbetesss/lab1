This is risky because those methods exist only under PHPUnit 5.x.
But our 5.3/5.4 builds only run 4.8
Isn't it?

All the methods are available from PHPUnit `4.x` to `6.x` (I take this careful while doing that). I guess I didn't get your ask :disappointed:

so, `php_unit_dedicate_assert` is safe for that?
eg `assertNan()` should not be used, `$this->assertTrue(is_nan(...))` should always be used instead.
I just want to ensure this will be the case :)

Oh, ok, now I get it. As I understood from PHP-CS-Fixer, [its checks the `PHPUnit` version before](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/2.8/src/Fixer/PhpUnit/PhpUnitDedicateAssertFixer.php#L84) doing this changes.
Maybe @keradus can help us :relaxed:

OK cool, can we then target 4.8 explicitly?

`4.8` no, but `3.5` yes. I'm running locally to see if we face it any incompatibility.

it doesn't check the installed version, as there could not be one installed yet, it checks requested version.

target could be configured for 3.0, 3.5, 5.0 and 5.6 (and newest ever).
as we run tests on phpunit 4.x as well, we need to set target for this fixer for highest compatible, thus 3.5. (@nicolas-grekas , then it will not affects `assertNan` !)
note: phpunit 3.6+ | 4.0+ did not introduced new assertions that could be fixed, that's why there is no target for them.

we shall not use one rule only. use full set instead: #25556
