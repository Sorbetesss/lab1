Do you know how this works? If the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` is present in 2.7+ but not in 2.3 and I open a PR in 2.3 the PR body will be empty?

Github has made an official post on this feature: https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates

IMO this should land as suggested by GitHub team in the `.github/` folder (also with other GH related files).

@Tobion I've made those two changes.

IMO the template should be removed from https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md then

:+1: for moving the file to `.github/`, as mentioned by the official blog post.

Alright I've moved the file to `.github/` and removed the template from `CONTRIBUTING`.  Let me know if you'd like to see any other changes.

You should also move the `CONTRIBUTING` inside the `.github` directory

@Taluu While GitHub does support that, I personally like seeing the `CONTRIBUTING` file in the root.  I tend to check that first instead of relying on GitHub to display the notice when creating the issue/PR later on.  Just my $0.02.
