:-1: on this change, as its goal is to allow using an invalid property path. The drupal code should be fixed instead.

Fair, for the usecase of symfony and custom PHP classes, this is not what you wanna do.
On the other hand, properties are an abstract concept, not necessarily bound to concrete classes.

I guess the way to fix it would be to use traversables for that part of our property path.

On the other hand I wish we would have communicated when the symfony validator was rewritten

I don't see why 0.value would be an invalid property path? Where does it say numbers are not allowed?
On the contrary, when numerically indexed arrays are validated you'll always end up with numbers in the property path?

@stof Why? To me this seems like a simple bug fix.

Agree, it's a simple bug fix. That the goal is a wrong use-case doesn't matter.

No response from @stof. I'm going to merge this.
