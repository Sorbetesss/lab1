I added a second commit with cs fixes, as it goes in master it should not be a pain to merge older branches as it would to merge it upward, right ?

Updated here, I've forgotten one method...

Is the second commit needed ? I can remove it. Thanks

@HeahDude when a CS fix could be applied on lower branches, it must be applied there.
Which means you can't trick the process this way :)
I'd recommend you revert the last commit, and *maybe* submit it to the lowest applicable branches.

@nicolas-grekas thanks, since this fixes are needed for a long time I thought it did not happens because it would have been a pain to merge upward from lower branches.

I revert it right away :)

@HeahDude actually, applying a CS fix only to the latest version would make any future upward merge painful due to conflicts.

Good to know!
