Nice feature, does this works on collection ? (don't think so seeing the code, and wondering if it's doable)

See https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/21669#issuecomment-280889824

I don't think those issues are addressed.

@joelwurtz you have right, an object collection in the parent has no populated object, the problem is to have a reference for linked the object passed in the 'object_to_populate' and the object received by decoding.

Either we consider this PR for objects containing other objects, or we have a solution to bind collection objects to the input received

I don't think this PR should solve that problem, futhermore, some users would have different behavior:

 * Replace: like actually
 * Merge: mainly if the index key is the same as the populated object we use the previous object for as an object to populate; also if previous index is not present we remove it, and if the new index is not present in the old list we add it
 * Append: keep current lists and add new object to the list

@jewome62 You need to rebase the PR as we don't merge PRs with merge commits.

Failure of unit tests is not related to this PR
