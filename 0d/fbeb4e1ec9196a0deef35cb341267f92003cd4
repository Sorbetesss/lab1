Shouldn't this PR targets the branch where classes were introduced?

@jderusse I don't know. My last PR's including unit tests for the Notifier was targeting master (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/38315/files) so I thought targeting 5.x is fine here.
But if there is any rule I'm happy to target another branch.

5.x is correct.
