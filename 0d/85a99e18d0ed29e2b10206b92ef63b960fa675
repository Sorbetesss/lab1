The refactoring made in #22043 is not the cause, reverting it makes this test keep failing on windows.

Wouldn't be better to fix the error on Windows or create alternative test which won't break there, instead of skipping the test?

Spent some hours at trying to debug it and I can't find the bottleneck, so keep skipping on windows as it runs fine on other platforms.
