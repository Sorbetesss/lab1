> I started reviewing this, but I'm not sure it's desired, the new name is not better when only one place exists - and code exists that would need to be upgraded, to a name that wouldn't fit well.

Everywhere else we are using `initialPlaces` - at the plural form.  So it's consistent with the rest of the component.

We should merge it in 4.3 to avoid confusion
