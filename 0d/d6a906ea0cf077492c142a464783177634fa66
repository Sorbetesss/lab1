@csarrazi I have recreated a new PR and deleted the old one because I merged the whole master branch in it inadvertently (I forgot it was based on 3.1)

I have removed the `null` check in `getAttributeValue` method and set a default value for `$uidKey` if `null` given. I also set the password to `null` if the password attribute is `null`.

Which branch is this fix for? There's a mismatch between the description and the selected base branch (no need to change because we can while merging.)

This fix is for the 3.1 branch, sorry!

ping @csarrazi (3.1 is EOLed in two weeks)

üëç , as I said in the previous PR. I would merge it against 3.1, as we still support it (even though EOL is in 2 weeks).

Should I care about the failure on AppVeyor as it does not seems related to the changes of this PR ?
