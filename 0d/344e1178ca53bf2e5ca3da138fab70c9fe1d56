Hum, I understand now !
But shouldn't we use `class_exists` instead ? Like is done in codebase ?

We could do that, yes.

given that this method is not used anywhere in the HttpKernel component and does not depend on anything else in the component (its only dependency is `token_get_all`), maybe we should copy it in the PhpDumper of the DI component as a private method and deprecate the Kernel method.

I deprecated method in `Kernel` and created a private in `PhpDumper`
