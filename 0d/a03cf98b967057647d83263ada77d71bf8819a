@fabpot, seems like you've confused @webmozart's nickname :)
+1 here, we need a way to disable HTML5 widgets somehow.

@fabpot I rebased the PR on master.

I know this PR is quite old but still useful, because the HTML5 date input lacks of real support even in latest browser version and jquery plugin like [bootstrap-datetimepicker](https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker)  need an input text.

Is there anything wrong that prevent merging I can fix ?

I fixed the test for initializing the data transformer and i rebased with squashing over master.

It is ready for merge.

@fabpot @stof  I rebased on latest master.
On travis the unit tests failed only on some PHP version and for components other than Form which is the only component modified by this PR.

Can you merge this PR however ?
