Personally, when this is contributed like here, I'm OK with adding this to the component directly, provided the implementation is top quality (double care for reviewers + author).

I prefer to have it in the core too

@jderusse @nicolas-grekas @iltar - The changes are made and ready for review with fully functional tests running in Travis using zookeeper service.

Could you please rebase? I refactored the .travis.yml file so you need to adapt your patch now. Thanks.

@jderusse - please let me know if there are additional concerns. I am also not sure why the test is failing in just 1 environment but succeeds in other environment without any issues.

@jderusse any more comment?

Thanks @nicolas-grekas for the comments, they were really helpful.

On your question
```
Tests are green but display "ZOO_ERROR@getaddrs@599: getaddrinfo: No such file or directory" messages, is it legit or does it hint an issue
```

I had tried debugging that but couldn't find root cause and gave up previously. Today however, I was able to find the root cause for that. I was setting the `ZOOKEEPER_HOST` `env` variable only in 1 `phpunit.xml` file. I put it in both places and those errors are gone now. Looks like the config is read from either of those files depending on the `deps`. I am also not skipping my tests anymore as they should always run correctly.
