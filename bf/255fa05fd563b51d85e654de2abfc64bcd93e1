Hey!

I think @Korbeil has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

With this, maybe my patch at https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/46453 is not necessary anymore?

Going to answer my own comment
```php
if (self::MUTATOR === $source && !$this->filterDocBlockParams($phpDocNode, $property)) {
    return null;
}
```

this guard can now indeed by removed, since you added more generic solution.
