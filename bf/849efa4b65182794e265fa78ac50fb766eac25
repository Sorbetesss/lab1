It may be possible by casting ReflectionParameter to string, isn't it?

It is possible, but it would take some work - the output looks like `Parameter #0 [ <required> Bar $bar ]`. Being able to capture the `Bar $bar` part would be cool to include, as it is what the the user actually sees in their code.

or by catching the exception message, should be much easier:
```
php > $p = new ReflectionParameter(...);
php > dump($p->getClass());
PHP Warning:  Uncaught exception 'ReflectionException' with message 'Class foobar does not exist'
```

I've done a simple version of what you suggested @nicolas-grekas - used the caught exception's message directly - here's what it looks like now: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/16467/files#diff-d124c3d39cd5f7c732fb3d3be7a8cb42R207
