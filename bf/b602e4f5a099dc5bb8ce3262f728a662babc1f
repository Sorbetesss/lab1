Exceptions should only be thrown by the validators if the developer made some mistake in their configuration and those exceptions should not be caught. Thus I would not document them here.

To comply with the API of a _constraint validator_, implementors should at least know about the `Unexpected...` exceptions.

Why not.. ?? I might have a controller that initializes my custom validator and I need to customize the message shown to the consumer of the controller by catching the exception...

I suggest something like

```
@throws UnexpectedTypeException If the constraint is incompatible
@throws UnexpectedTypeException If the value is incompatible (causes an unrecoverable error)
@throws UnexpectedValueException If the value is incompatible (causes a recoverable violation)
@throws ConstraintDefintionException If a constraint option is incompatible during runtime
@throws ValidatorException If any other validation related error occured
```

im :+-0: on adding ValidatorException specifically; i've no real proof it was designed like that. It seems reasonable, though in practice it could be a plain \RuntimeException as well. Which is why im skeptical about adding it now.

> I might have a controller that initializes my custom validator and I need to customize the message shown to the consumer of the controller by catching the exception...

In this case, i think you could throw a custom exception as well, and document it on your custom constraint validator.

@ro0NL I saw that you added above also this

```
@throws ValidatorException If any other validation related error occured
```

I can agree with that then.. I thought that in your review comment you you wanted to remove the generic one and add only the specific ones...

I made some changes according to @ro0NL but... I haven't added the `UnexpectedValueException`. This exception exists on master and I am targeting 3.4

Done. I left only one exception as discussed.
