Same issue affects the Lock component, and could be patched in the same way. I will open a PR when this one will be merged to reuse the RedisProxy. (thanks FWBundle has a dependency on Cache)

Diff is to take into account and allow the new class  `RedisProxy` in `Symfony\Component\Lock\Store\RedisStore` and in `Symfony\Component\Lock\Store\StoreFactory` and add the `array('lazy' => true)` in the `FrameworkExtension`
