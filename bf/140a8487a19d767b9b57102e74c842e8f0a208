Please implement the featur ein a BC way, otherwise it means it cannot be merged until we move to 3.0

Fixed. Did I miss something?

Also do you have an idea about how to solve this? The `FrameworkBundle:HttpCache\HttpCache`-class is hard-wired to the `Esi` class and additionally it also pushes this into the DIC. I've added a method `getName()` to `Esi` and `Ssi`, so when somebody overwrites `createSurrogate()` it works as at least I'd expect it, but I'm not totally happy with that.

So in my opinion it is fine for now, but maybe somebody has an idea?

Really looking forward to see this functionality in Symfony :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, updated once more. Sorry for the inconvenience with the BC

I've mentioned in the source, that the components are deprecated since 2.5, but actually I don't really know. It's too late for 2.5, isn't?

Are there any other concerns?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@KingCrunch yes it is. 2.5 is already feature-frozen. It will come in 2.6 now

@KingCrunch Looks good to me. Can you fix the minor issues I've mentioned in the comments? Thanks.

:+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2014-06-18T08:11:37Z

@KingCrunch Thanks for that. Can you fix the fabbot errors (mainly about using `bool` instead of `Boolean`?)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by KingCrunch at 2014-06-20T08:20:23Z

Rebase and pushed. Actually some days ago already, but I don't know, if it's fine to "ping" after every commit :X

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2014-06-20T08:32:03Z

@KingCrunch Pinging is fine, but we now need 2 +1 from the core team before being able to merge this PR. http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/core_team.html#code-development-rules
