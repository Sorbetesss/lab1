I decided at first to skip type-hints on methods throwing `MethodNotImplementedException` anyway.

But since https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/32525#pullrequestreview-261529651 was asked I've decided to be consistent through the rest of the codebase:

It seems almost all classes in intl which are affected here are internal classes, e.g. for polyfill that are not meant to be extended. So we can add type hints in 4.4 to them because we don't need parameter variance from 7.2. What do you think @nicolas-grekas ?
And we could add return types as well without having to worry.

@Tobion I was about to answer yes, but `./src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Resources/stubs/Collator.php` contains a non-internal class, which extends the internal `Collator`. As such we cannot do more in 4.4.
