Could you improve the PR and commit title please also? (I'd suggest to squash commits while doing so)

Thanks, LGTM, except the test failure of course.

Thanks @ro0NL for the comments, good catch!
@sylfabre OK to you with the comments? They all make sense to me (please rebase also.)

Status: needs work

@nicolas-grekas @ro0NL I've rebased and updated the PR as per your comments.

I've also updated accordingly the code I used as source for my feature

> we need to decide if we add the $constraint instanceof Bic and throw (BC break-ish) or trigger deprecation

easy to decide: no BC breaks :)
