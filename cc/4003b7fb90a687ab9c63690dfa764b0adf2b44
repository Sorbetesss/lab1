One thing that seems gone is showing which transport was used for each email (previously, it was shown in the tabs switching between emails)

@javiereguiluz can you share the before/after comparison for how the panel looks like with multiple transports ?

@stof thanks for the review. About the transport, to reduce the noise I thought it was a good idea to only display the transport if there's more than one transport. This is how it'd look like when showing the transport name:

But thanks to your comment, I realized that maybe your app defines multiple transports, but this request only used one of them ... so you need the transport info somewhere. What about showing it like this:

<img width="742" alt="mailer-transport-information" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/191512144-58ac5483-2e16-477d-b0f7-230827ec3043.png">

Do you know how long can be the transport name in practice? It's the full DNS or a human-friendly short name? Thanks!

IIRC, it is the full DSN (minus the auth part)

Given that it's the DSN, I've updated the design as follows:

what about showing multiple emails inbox-like? eg. a list of subject and date.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2022-09-21T13:51:38Z

@ro0NL I doubt you will have web requests sending lots of emails (such case must be handled asynchronously). So it is better to optimize the experience for a few emails than for the case of a big list IMO.

im not sure how not seeing the subject improves the experience ...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2022-09-21T13:55:57Z

Well, if you want to display the subject instead of just `#1` and `#2`, it requires moving away from horizontal tabs then (as the subject won't fit in them), which means adding much more space for this email switcher.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I liked @ro0NL proposal, so I gave it a shot ... and I think it works better. It now shows a clickable list of messages to follow the familiar behavior of email clients:

![mailer-email-list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/191545703-4db85b42-a9aa-4301-8d22-0d438df844b0.gif)

We also protect the design against too long lists:

@stof I thought about what you said and I think you were right. That's why I've changed my mind and introduced some buttons in the table of emails to make it accessible.

This is how it looks when using a browser with accessibility capabilities. In regular browsers, the buttons are completely hidden:

So, I think this feature is now ready and complete. Thanks.
