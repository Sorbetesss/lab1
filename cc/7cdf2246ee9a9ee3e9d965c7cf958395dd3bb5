Hello @nicolas-grekas,

I played with this new calculation method and it gives an entropy that is approx +40% compare to the one I proposed.
I have no remark to be honest.
* A 8-chars password with [a-zA-Z0-9]+symbols has almost always a strength of 2, which is fine.
* A 10-chars ones gives 3
* With 12-chars or more I have 4
Looks good to me 👌🏼.

Also, as noted by @stof in this https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/49868#discussion_r1154638964, the named argument of [constriant](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7c459424b703e9b820b300a14194f701fb5bbb19/src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Constraints/PasswordStrength.php#L43) should be at the end.
We could take the opportunity of this PR to move the argument `$minScore`.

Right, updated!

Thanks for checking. I think the new logic better accounts for things like mixing character case, symbols, and other and also duplicate chars.
