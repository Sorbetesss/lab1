I've found info outputs like this super helpful in my CI. I do them for PHP versions and versions of static tools.

Hm I never said this PR was fixing the linked issue.

Displaying the info of PHP 7.2, when running the "5.6 + 7.0 + 7.1 + 7.2" test-suite is useless.
The purpose of this PR was to display the PHP info of all tested versions (and not only the last version)

If we don't need this, then I suggest to remove this step.

Please don't merge it before CI green. I'm not 100% confident with the syntax
