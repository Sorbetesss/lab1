Hey!

I think @alli83 has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Would it be possible to add support in `BinaryFileResponse` instead?

It doesn't seem to. `BinaryFileResponse` needs a "physical" file. This would mean that the temporary file would have to be physically written to disk each time, and we'd lose the whole point of this new method I guess.

BinaryFileResponse accepts an SplFileInfo as argument and SplTempFileObject extends SplFileInfo, so it's already possible to pass a SplTempFileObject there. Can't we make BinaryFileResponse able to deal with such instances, skipping all the features that need a physical file when this happens?

Thank you for the hint Nicolas, I tried a implementation in `BinaryFileResponse` to add support for `\SplTempFileObject`

@alexandre-daubois Can you rebase on current 7.1? Thank you.
