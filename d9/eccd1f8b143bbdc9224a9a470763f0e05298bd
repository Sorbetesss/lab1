Symfony doesn't do backward-incompatible changes without deprecating first, this should target 6.4 and provide BC layers if/where needed.

@chalasr Nicolas and Christian are giving me instructions for the same issue [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/50396). I'm having a look, thanks!

AFAICT there is no BC break here, this should be fine as-is on 6.4.

I agree, as it is widening the type

I thought again about it, you're right, it shouldn't cause any issue as it is in the constructor. Thank you both :pray:
