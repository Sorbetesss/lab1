I consider that the `csv` name describes this processor perfectly üëç  `array` or `simple_array` would be confusing in this case.

I don't get how to make the test green. The base64 test is green and it's almost the same. Do you have a hint?

OH, in fact this CS fix has already been done on master AFAIK, so please just rebase to relaunch tests.

Can we rename to `csv_row` instead of `csv`? Someone might think this should parse csv string with newlines into array of arrays and submit bug reports. `csv_row` is less ambiguous and more future proof.

@ostrolucky "csv_row" looks like noisy boilerplate to me. Native's `str_getcsv` doesn't have "row" in its name btw.
