what is the impact of enabling `utf8` for all routes ? Would they match different things ?

A URL containing above-ASCII chars presented in a non-UTF8 charset by a browser would be 404 where it would not necessarily today. But when the app is configured with `kernel.charset=UTF-8`, I fail to see any practical use case since nobody can know in which charset it is really. As such it would be hard to map to any actual content/resource...

I agree with @stof. This looks absolutely reasonable and the right thing to do üëç ... but I can't imagine the consequences (if any): would any route matching change? would routing performance be lower? etc.

To be extra safe, I added a new config option to enable utf8 mode, off by default, with a note in UPGRADE-4.2 to invite to turn it on.
