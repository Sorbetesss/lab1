I would do the same as for `ircmaxell/password-compat` where we require either the right PHP version or the dep in `composer.json` (#7853), at least for 3.0.

@fabpot This PR adds support for the `random_bytes` function in 2.3 if it is available (either by using PHP 7 or by manually including the compat library).

#15879 deprecates the SecureRandom class for 2.8 and #15880 removes the class for 3.0 and only uses the `random_bytes` function with a hard dependency on the `paragonie/random_compat` library (which will only define the necessary functions when they are not available, I.E PHP < 7).

I'm not sure if this is what you had in mind
