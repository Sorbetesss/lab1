appveyor is not happy but I believe it has nothing to do with me. Does it ?

O_O Does it mean you are rejecting this one ?

What I want, is to be able to differentiate transitions that will be done automatically from others that will be done manually.
If not with the context, how do you suggest to do that ?

I found an old [PR](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/30902/files) and realized the TransitionEvent knows the context ^^

I'll use this event, then. But I really don't understand why the other events do not deserve to know the context ^^

Oups, I write the comment but I forgot to remove it :+1:

I'm against to put the context in the guard event but for other event I guess this is fine :+1:

Great ! So, GuardEvent is not aware of the context anymore. I simplified TransitionEvent. And TransitionEvent is still the only event which can change the context.
