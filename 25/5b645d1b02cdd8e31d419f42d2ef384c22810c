Can you also add a note in the Routing component CHANGELOG stating that these parameters are deprecated? And also a note in UPGRADE-3.3.md? Thanks.

is there a way to trigger a deprecation warning (in a late compiler pass maybe) when these parameters are replaced with values different than the default ones ?

@stof I don't remember doing so when we removed such params in 3.0, did we? Not sure it's really worth it.
