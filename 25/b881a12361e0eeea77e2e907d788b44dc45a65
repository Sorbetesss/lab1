Yes sure, I have not created a recipe yet so will read into it first.

@OskarStark

Docs: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/20018
Recipe: https://github.com/symfony/recipes/pull/1323

Is this the correct way to do this?

@OskarStark Maybe you can answer me two more questions:

1) Is it normal that 3 of the tests fail and if not, what can I do to fix these?

2) The recipe tests fail because the missing package on packagist. Shall I upload the package there or how is the workflow regarding those optional parts of symfony?

Best regards
Lukas

You can ignore all errors that are not related to your work.

This will be automatically fixed when I will submit the package. Nothing to do on your side.

The failures in the „Verify Packages“ job are related. Looks like some files are missing. You can take inspiration from other existing bridges.

There are some hidden useful information in the broken tests:

```
  File src/Symfony/Component/Notifier/Bridge/Sipgate/.gitattributes does not exist
  File src/Symfony/Component/Notifier/Bridge/Sipgate/.gitignore does not exist
  File src/Symfony/Component/Notifier/Bridge/Sipgate/phpunit.xml.dist does not exist
```

I've added the missing files but the _Verify Packages_ check still fails, this time because of "Composer.json's replace section needs to contain symfony/sipgate-notifier".

I have read into the composer schema and also looked into other comparable packages and can't find a clue why I should do that.

Of course I could simply add it but that does not seem to be right, maybe you can give me some insight for that?
(Maybe it correlates with comment of @OskarStark  https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/57627#discussion_r1663579197)
