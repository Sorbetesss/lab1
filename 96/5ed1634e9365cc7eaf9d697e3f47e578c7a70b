Why is this a trait BTW, and not plain methods on WebTestCase?
Unless I missed it, #30813 doesn't tell about that, does it?

I canâ€™t remember why, maybe @pierstoval can help us

The trait was not discussed, I thought it was convenient to have all assertions in one place, especially when needing them statically. A fix to make the client static in the trait is welcomed, indeed.
