@aweelex Does it work if we pass the timezone as a `DateTimeZone()` instance to the `IntlDateFormatter` constructor instead?

@xabbuh oh, yes. And it seems to be the best way to solve this problem. Because we already have exeption on wrong `DateTimeZone ` in `DataTransformerInterface`.

Thank you for checking. Can you rebase your changes on the `3.4` branch? It's affected too, right?

Ok, it seems that changes should go to 3.4 and 4.4. I rebased commits to 3.4. Is everything alright here? @nicolas-grekas?
