I am going on holidays, as said in the Symfony Slack, I was unable to do a `composer update` on the 5.4 branch so was unable to run tests locally.

If someone wants to finish the work, go for it, otherwise I'll finish in January :-)

Note that 6.1 is our current feature branch. 5.4 is closed for features.

So no way of having this new small feature before SF6.1? That would be a shame imo

Yes. We only merge features in the unstable branch. For already released versions, stability is top priority so there should be as little changes in each patch release as possible (and definitely no new features).

No way, sorry.

The final failing checks fail on issues that I don't think are related to my code. What can I do about it?

@derrabus Do you have time to review the final changes? Should I implement the configuration exception you were talking about?

@chalasr I see that your review is required too here :-)

Looks good to me once Alexander's comment is addressed (please ping if the given material is not enough)

I still have a failing check with Psalm, but the error seems to be on loading Psalm, so I don't know what I can do about it!

Can you update the SecurityBundle's changelog? The psalm issue is unrelated.
