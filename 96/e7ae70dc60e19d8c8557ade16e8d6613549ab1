Hey!

I think @VincentLanglet has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Don't really feel like I broke any test, here. ^^

should this `label` attribute be set when there is a placeholder provided ? Or should the `--` be the default text of the option instead ?

That's an excellent question, @stof. My understanding so far is that the placeholder should provide a value, hence removing the need for the label attribute. (if I read everything correctly)

Not sure about this change, but that would be for 6.2.

Haha I totally forgot about that PR. I just had to re-read it. XD

Was just an ultra-low-priority suggestion.

I can delete this and do a new one on 6.2, if not already done.

> Can you please rebase for 6.2?

Done! :)

> Also, why not go with `: '--'` on the ternary op inside the tag? That'd make more sense to me.

My brain is in slow mode today (rhinopharyngitis), not sure I understand what you mean ^^
