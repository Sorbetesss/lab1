The private method has been typed correctly but it is called from a public method that in practice allows to pass `null` values. I've fixed the code around it, but I'm not sure if should we deprecating to pass `null` first? and relax the argument to `?string $id` by now? then in 5.0 go back to `string $id` again?

Instead of deprecating to pass `null` I've implemented a soft solution without deprecation, wdyt?

Works for me. We'd need a test case to ensure we don't break this by mistake.
