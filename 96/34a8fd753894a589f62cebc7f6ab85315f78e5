Something went bad when merging, can you re-push your work here? Sorry about that.

I've made a _git push --force_ it's that enough? If you need anything else, tell me.

It's not enough. You need to execute `git rebase origin/master` as this will remove the merge commits.

created new origin "sf" (symfony/symfony)
`git pull sf master`
`git push origin master`
`git checkout add_html_dumper_theme_config_option`
`git rebase origin/master`
and `git push --force`

I hope i've done well this time
