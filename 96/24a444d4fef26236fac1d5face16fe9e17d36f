Looks good to me (appveyor failure is unrelated - existed before)

Out of curiosity: Do you know why `7.2.9` was originally picked as minimal requirement?

I think it's the version Debian ships

Why was the min PHP-version lowered to `7.2.5` and not `7.2`?

.0 versions are always buggy and we don't want to test with them and workaround these early bugs.

mhm, seems to not being accepted?

Note:
7.2.5 -> Security fix
7.2.8 -> Security fix

https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#PHP_7_2

Maybe a good idea to note somewhere that, although Symfony supports 7.2.5, it is advised to always update to latest patch?

Also, I would guess the core team already has ideas/has thought about this, but 7.1 security support is being dropped at the end of the month. Same for 7.2 only receiving security patches as of 30 nov. Haven't seen documentation specifically relating to this? (Symfony 3.4 LTS supports 7.0 and up?)

Could be, but SUSE Linux (up to 15) only has php 7.2.5. This is a major show stopper.

Distributions backport security fixes, that's why ppl pay for them. It's not our job to safeguard ppl from themselves :)

tests are failing for the Cache PdoAdapter and the Lock PdoStore. Not sure whether this is related to the new PHP version or whether they were already broken on Windows.

@stof not related to this PR, I noticed these failures before, reported in #34444
