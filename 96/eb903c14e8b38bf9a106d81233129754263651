IIRC, when dumping the reference, we never use an inline notation (but we generate the Yaml by hand). So I would suggest using a bigger value than that, to ensure that the expanded notation is used (what do you think of using ``10``?)

I am not convinced that we should keep doing the dump manually in the `config:dump-reference` command. What was the initial reason to do that? But anyway, that's a different topic imo.

@stof good idea. I increased the level to `10`.

@xabbuh supporting comments, prototype nodes, etc.

I propose to merge it in 2.3 instead. As the output is still valid YAML, the only change is visual for our users, who will love to get this ASAP. WDYT?
