I don't see anything wrong in the current naming.

if we consider "database" a more sophisticated system evolving around data, id say the implementation indeed relies on a storage system, not a database system.

I agree that "database" looks wrong because we don't have a database here ... but what about removing any details about the storage?

Original:

```
No profiles found in the database.
Token ~ token|default('') ~ was not found in the database.
```

This PR:

```
No profiles found in the storage.
Token ~ token|default('') ~ was not found in the storage.
```

Proposal:

```
No profiles found.
Token ~ token|default('') ~ was not found.
```

We can yes üëçüèª

The main idea behind was to dissociate with the database word, as a newcomer may search for nothing the profiler table data inside its database, for example like the messenger table, but for nothing :)
