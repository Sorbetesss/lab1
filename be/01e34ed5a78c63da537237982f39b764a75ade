Is there anything I can do to help get this merged?

@DRvanR convince @beberlei to have a look at the change ;)

@DRvanR Can you refactor this to remove the array_walk in is_array and have both if conditions use the same looping mechanism? Otherwise this looks ok. I don't know if there are any tests for this though and we can rely on this working without you adding a new test. I would prefer a test

@beberlei will do, will try to have something by the end of the week (swamped with work atm). Do note however that it is `array_walk_recursive`, with [explicitly commented][1] support for recursive arrays. Seems that removing that might be a potential BC break?
