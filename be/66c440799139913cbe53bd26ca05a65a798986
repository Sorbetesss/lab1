As the native implementation uses `validateOnParse`, I think your alternative implementation needs to check `$html5->hasErrors()` and throw based on `$html5->getErrors()` too. Otherwise, parse errors might go unnoticed.

Due to https://github.com/Masterminds/html5-php/issues/139, shouldn't we use the `saveHTML` of the HTML5 library instead of the native one when use use the HTML5 parser to parse the DOM (meaning we need to also remember whether the DOM was created by the HTML5 parser)

Tests are failing for an unrelated reason. I think this is ready to review.
