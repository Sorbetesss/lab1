I would not need really the commands by default, i guess.

What about moving `WebServer` to symfony/process. As it already uses that, there's no real dependency issue or so. `PhpServerProcess`?

Auto-port detection has just been added. I've also updated the description to describe usage and differences with current commands.

Also, as the behavior have changed this need - at least - an issue to document it :)

I've found a minor error when using `server:start` repeatedly in the same project:

![server-start-error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/21693733/5d01de34-d382-11e6-8e4a-d23526d542ea.png)

The error message says that the server is listening on 8001 instead of 8000.

@javiereguiluz  `server:start` command fixed when the web server is already running.
