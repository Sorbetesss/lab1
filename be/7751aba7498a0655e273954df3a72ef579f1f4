From what I see, it should work, I need to test it in the original context I got the error, I can only do that at work so I'll give you a straight answer within the next week.

As a side note I'm afraid this will truncate reported file names, am I wrong ? Isn't there a more straight method to determine the project root ? Something from configuration or a constant or anything else would be great actually.

This is pure visual truncation so we don't really care if it's not perfect.

Seems legit, I will test it as soon as I can, thanks for patching so fast.
