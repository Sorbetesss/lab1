I wanted to check how the result of this PR looks like in my SF 4.4 application (Console v4.4.37) and it seems the OutputFormatterStyle does not allow arbitrary colors.

PHPStorm Console (Mac, zsh):

Replacing the colors with `yellow` and `blue` would work:

@derrabus
Code is pure, clean, simple.  There should be no political positions.
There is one time, will be countless times.
Today it could be Ukraine, tomorrow could be CN, US, GB or other.

I don't mean to be rude, but seeing “stand with Ukraine” will make me unhappy, beacause the symfony is the greate framework in my heart, i don’t want it to be a political tool.

but sadly, and your ceo looks very glad to do it.
look https://github.com/symfony-cli/symfony-cli/commit/d09ad2d8eb57a9bc910226a188bea3c8d240ffca

My mistake, I created the PR on 5.4 first, then backported it to 4.4. Will fix it before the merge of course.

I agree too, in my opinion code should not spread any political position.
That said if tools want to add some notice in places that do not affect any user directly (like packagist or phpunit did in the version lines) that's kind of okay.

Which is exactly what we are doing here, right?

I think you put your idea on the website is enough.  There is no need to add it to the code.

even It's already affecting me to read the document, and not only me.

Probably, this PR is missing a description screenshot as reading the code is not very clear how it will affect outputs ;)

Opposing a war is not a political position. Helping the victims of a war is not a political position.

Screenshots were added for more clarity.

yes, i absolutely agree with you.

Uh....em...  but, is not The Syrian and Iraq in the war?

i will never reply it, If you put the text "love and peace", "hope the world haven't war".

you stand with Ukraine , why don't stand with Syrian and Iraq or other country in the war together?

it's is why i say it is political position.

Please look up "whataboutism". I'm not taking that bait.
