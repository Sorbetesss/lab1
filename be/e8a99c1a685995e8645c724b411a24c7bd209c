Looks good to me, can you add some unit tests?

I'm wondering if we could extract `NumberFormatter::round()` functionality to public-available method. There's `Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\DataTransformer\NumberToLocalizedStringTransformer::round()` with the same functionality. We could also use this method in `Twig_Extension_Core::twig_round()` to provide more rounding modes. The only downside I see is dependency with library containing this rounding method.

I prefer duplicate code in this case
