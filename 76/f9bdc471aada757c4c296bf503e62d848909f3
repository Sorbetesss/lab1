Wouldnâ€™t it make more sense to move the service back to the `messenger.xml` file instead of creating a new one?

@sroze the collector should not be registered if the profiler is not enabled, so we would need to remove the definition. Adding the `_debug.xml` file is consistent with what we do for other optional components
