> the PR should target 4.4, as a new "feature"

Did it, and removed the upgrade line. However, I do not understand why this is considered a new feature instead of a BC break. ðŸ¤”

If it's considered as a BC break, then merging on master is equally wrong: we don't do hard BC breaks that don't trigger a prior notice in 4.4.

Now we can discuss the BC break nature of this.

This is a BC break only if some class implements `HttpExceptionInterface` without actually extending a base exception. I think that doesn't exist. So we're in the "yes" of the table on https://symfony.com/bc

I see your point, I don't think anyone did this too.
