Please no overrides dir. just keep it inside a bundles dir. Does it really matter. The one working on code knows.

Just a question; should we deprecate the old paths (hardcoded in src).

Ie trigger in case of `if (file_exists($dir = $container->getParameter('kernel.root_dir').'/Resources/views')) {` etc. Wouldnt that me more concise?

Only if not configured as path already of course.
