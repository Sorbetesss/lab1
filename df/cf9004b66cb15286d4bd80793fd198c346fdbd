* `Static analysis / Psalm (pull_request)`: does not seem relevant
* `continuous-integration/appveyor/pr`: the error seems to be related to a timeout issue
* `PHPUnit / Tests (8.2) (pull_request)`: the error reported here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/runs/6538975401?check_suite_focus=true#step:8:2110 is related to another (unchanged) component. **Should I fix it?**
* `PHPUnit / Tests (8.1, low-deps) (pull_request)`: *Error: Class "Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Authenticator\AccessTokenAuthenticator" not found* I don't understand this issue. The class is present in the PR

Thanks for checking all tests! (btw, I'll look at the PR somewhere after 6.1 is released)

We'll ignore it for this PR (but if you want, a separate PR with a fix is always welcome :wink: )

See https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/pull_requests.html#automated-tests You must update the minimum versions in e.g. the SecurityBundle.

Hi,

Many thanks for your comments.
I updated the authenticator that is now based on token "extractors".

```yaml
security:
    firewalls:
        main:
            pattern: ^/
            access_token:
                token_handler: access_token.access_token_handler
#                token_extractors:
#                    header: 'security.access_token_extractor.header' # This extrator is set by default
```

You can add any extractor you want. Three already exist:

* `security.access_token_extractor.header`
* `security.access_token_extractor.query_string`
* `security.access_token_extractor.request_body`

You can create as many extractors you need. They shall implement `Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Authenticator\AccessToken\AccessTokenExtractorInterface` and the method `extractToken`.

Other parameters are also present:

```yaml
security:
    firewalls:
        main:
            pattern: ^/
            access_token:
                token_handler: access_token.access_token_handler
                success_handler: access_token.success_handler
                failure_handler: access_token.failure_handler
                user_provider: 'another.user_provider'
                token_extractors:
                    - 'security.access_token_extractor.header'
                    - 'security.access_token_extractor.query_string'
                    - 'security.access_token_extractor.request_body'
                    - 'App\Security\CustomExtractor'
```

I have not created Exceptions. I revised my mind as the existing ones seem sufficient.
WDYT?

Best regards.

Hi all,

Would you mind to review the changes I made and if the comments you raised have correctly been addressed?
Let me know if you see other modifications I should consider.

Many thanks.

@Spomky if you click on the "load more ...", you'll see a review from me. I guess GitHub immediately hid it, so it got lost 🙂

Ah, regarding https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/46428#discussion_r878912749 I don't feel like we should remove these extractors now that they are there, it's spec compliant after all.
However maybe could we at least add a some phpdoc to mention these are not recommended with the principal reasons and/or a link to the relevant part of the spec?

Many thanks for the review and comments.
I think I addressed all of them (including those hidden by github).
Let me know if you have any others.

Excellent! Many thanks to you and all the other reviewers.
I edited the few things you spotted and squashed the PR.
This is a big step for me and I really hope it will help many developers to integrate token-based authentication.
