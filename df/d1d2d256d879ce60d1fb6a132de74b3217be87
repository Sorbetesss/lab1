This makes the redirection/forward icon to be closer to the status panel than before ... but it's probably  OK:

Maybe the better solution is to wrap up the optionally displayed SVG and the other elements representing the route in a single element that has the `margin-left`?

We're always cautious about modifying the HTML structure ... so maybe the following would suffice:

```css
.sf-toolbar-block-request .sf-toolbar-status + svg {
    margin-left: 5px;
}
```

Updated, that fixes both scenarios :)
