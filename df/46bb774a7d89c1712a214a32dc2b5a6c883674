@xabbuh you need to rebase your branch so that it starts from 2.7 too. Otherwise, you are asking us to merge the master branch codebase into 2.7, which won't happen

@stof already done (I switched the branch here as I read @fabpot's command in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/20116#issuecomment-250918139 too late)
