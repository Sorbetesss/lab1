Nice :+1: what about `bin/console list --show-hidden`? The idea of hidden commands was to exclude them by default (for not having a contextual relevance).

Looks like an idea to me :)

But I'd like to keep meaningful defaults based on the format unless the `--show-hidden` flag is provided/explicitly set to `true/false` (`InputOption::VALUE_OPTIONAL` with default acting as auto).

Anyway, let's first approve this one before.

> meaningful defaults based on the format

Technically they dont know about each other.. they should not make assumptions regarding context imo. The only context we do have is "hidden", probably meaning; dont bother the user with it.

So :+1: for defaulting to false, where defaulting is needed. But i understand you actually chose to differ between XML/JSON and markdown here. Always providing the information technically in that case.

I think we should do format based decision making at command level. More close to real user decision making. Although it could still be experienced counter-intuitive. No real opinion here :)

Im not sure you wanna do 2 PR's? But imo. it can be 1, doing the feature as a whole. Right now master is good (imo.); consistently hidden by default. Not sure we want this intermediate step, or as final solution for that matter, again imo.

For me :+1: adding `--show-hidden` to bypass the hardcoded default.

Just waiting for some more feedbacks on this and the option suggestion.

But ok, done.

I think I'm :-1: on the `--show-hidden` option. That would defeat the whole purpose of the hidden feature as accepted when it was introduced.

Sounds reasonable. But it really depends what "hidden" means. Is it only from a end-user perspective? GUI-wise?

Then the initial (by now ;-)) approach makes sense. Including for technical formats, excluding for human formats.

There is one more thing to consider regarding the `--show-hidden` option: It feels strange for both `xml` and `json` formats to get the `hidden` information always added as an attribute. If it doesn't include hidden commands, this is pretty useless.

I'll wait some more opinions and remove the option if it doesn't seem appropriated.

Not sure, we wanna micro optimize that? The definition is clear, allowing everybody to rely on it consistently.

"Then the initial (by now ;-)) approach makes sense. Including for technical formats, excluding for human formats." -> like that.

`--show-hidden` option removed :)
