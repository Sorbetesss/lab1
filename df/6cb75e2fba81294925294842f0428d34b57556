Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.4, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2.

Cheers!

I've added a test for this based on the initial report of the issue.  A bunch of the tests are failing but the failures seem to be unrelated to this change.
