Would it make sense to allow the title to be at the bottom as well?

@fabpot What do you mean by "at the bottom"? The second line of the header or the very last line of the table?

I was thinking about the last line of the table.

IMO, shown the title only in the first line is enough.

Not sure I understand the "enough" part. I was thinking about letting the user choose between displaying the title at the top or at the bottom (depending on what you want to achieve, doing one or the other might make more sense).

What about `setHeaderTitle` + `setFooterTitle`? Agree a title at the bottom might be useful, e.g. pagination info  or some resultset status text.

Also sometimes the table is too big, showing the title in both places (top/bottom) would be nice, avoids scrolling.

As suggested, I added `setHeaderTitle()` and `setFooterTitle()` methods:
