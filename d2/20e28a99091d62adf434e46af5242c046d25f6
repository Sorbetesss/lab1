Should probably go into 3.4 as it's a new feature, even though I know why it "broke".

@iltar this tries to remove a behavior change introduced in #23195

I'd propose to reverse the flag, and submit it on 3.4, as a new feature, so that people can opt-out if they want (yes, that'd mean keeping the BC break, I know, let's live with that.)
