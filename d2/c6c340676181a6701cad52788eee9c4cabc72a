:+1: This would also fix #11909.

Great, thanks! Could you add the corresponding assertions to `FrameworkExtensionTest::testValidation*Api()`?

Done. One thing is strange, with each added assertion the count of executed assertions increased by three. If you modify one assertion to fail you will get 3 failed tests.

@peterrehm The extension tests are executed three times, once for each format (YAML, XML, PHP).

Thanks, expected something like that but had no time left yesterday to investigate. Now this should be good to go. I think this should be merged into the 2.5 branch.
