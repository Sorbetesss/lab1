Ah, I forgot about this one. As I wrote on another PR, ORMv3 makes `LazyServiceEntityRepository` useless, we should deprecate and drop it.

Yes, but we still need a solution for ORM 2 which will stay around for a while.

> we should deprecate and drop it.

`LazyServiceEntityRepository` is marked as internal, so we can drop that class without deprecation. If we find a way to keep the laziness of `ServiceEntityRepository` for ORM 2, I'm fine with the late removal of this feature. I won't have time to work on that though. 😕
