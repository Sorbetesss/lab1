Indeed, but the component has been released as [experimental](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/experimental.html) to allow for such changes if needed.

That's also why I'd like to get this in NOW for 6.4 - the component will be stable in 6.4, so making a change like this will be harder. We're already dipping a little beyond the 6.4 feature-freeze date :)

@shyim While I think this PR is valid and should be merged, since you created the original issue, if you were able to validate that this gives you what you need, that would help :)

~~Test failures in AssetMapper - but it looks like it's coming from #50734 - the `$this` variable in~~ https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/934aea0b32ed6caea3cf5e1e4bb4cbc05417b424/src/Symfony/Component/ErrorHandler/Resources/views/trace.html.php#L14 ~~is an instance of `HtmlErrorRenderer`~~

Rebased and those tests are fixed.
