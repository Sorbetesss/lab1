Such BC break cannot be done in 3.x

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Stof I was unsure about that, as for me this is a serious bug in the current behaviour.

If that is not possible the only way would be option 2 and 3 where I would prefer 2.

Could this target 4.x? Not sure this is common.. but master could trigger a deprecation error about changing behavior in 4.x right?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

master could introduce the deprecation, so option 2 or 3 should be possible.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, but option 1 would be ideal right? I.e. option 1 & 2 are practically the same, it just proposes to rename the option.. which isnt necessarily needed imo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, it would be great to fix it without the rename, lets see.

Options 2 or 3 are the only viable solutions, to preserve BC and enable a continuous upgrade path.

If noone has a good use case for being able to switch the behaviour of the constraint, I would deprecate setting the `strict` option to `false` and change the default value of it in `4.0`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated accordingly. The open decision is if we want to deprecate the entire option or just the default value and as later still allow setting it to false.

Should be good to go from my end now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2016-08-08T06:52:36Z

Any further feedback?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2016-08-08T08:02:00Z

Can you update the upgrade file for 4.0 too please? Besides that the changes look good to me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated. Besides that the BC Break can be removed as the current solution does not contain any BC break.
