> The DefinitionDecorator class does not deal with decorated services

It reflects service that decorates another one, doesn't it?

@unkind no. The decorates feature uses normal definition to configure the composition (as the service definition for the decorator does not need to reuse anything from the original service as it gets it as a dependency instead).
DefinitionDecorator is used for the ``parent`` feature, i.e. a definition extending another one

DerivedDefinition? ChildDefinition?

I renamed `DefinitionExtension` to `ChildDefinition`.

I'm tempted to vote +1, but then I also considered the burden that we'll put on bundles & co. Not sure it's worth it...

Given the confusion this class name caused in the past and still causes, I think we should dare to make this deprecation now and get rid of it in 4.0.
