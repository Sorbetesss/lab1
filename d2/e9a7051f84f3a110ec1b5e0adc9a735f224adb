@symfony/deciders I would like to hear your opinion on this topic? Do you think it's worth to finish this approach? Should we take another road?

IMO it's a good move. We still need to be able to get both impersonator/impersonated user from the token, I guess it's planed

@chalasr I guess the `SwitchUserToken` (or maybe better `SwitchedUserToken`) suggested by @HeahDude could be a good solution.

Agreed, that would remove the need for `isUserSwitched`.

@xabbuh will you have tome to finish this PR for 3.4?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2017-09-26T13:47:58Z

Yes, I am working on it.

should we move to 4.1?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2017-10-08T16:07:13Z

I think so.

I would love to see this in 4.3 :) /cc @xabbuh
