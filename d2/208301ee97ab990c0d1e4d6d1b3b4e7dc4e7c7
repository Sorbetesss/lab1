@natechicago thanks for contributing this fix. As a very minor comment, next time is enough to include the fixed ticket number in the table and prefix it with `#` so GitHub turns it into a link. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz thanks for the tip!  @sstok I've added an appropriate unit test to make sure this problem won't recur in the future.

checkdnsrr mocking implemented in #18181
I propose to rebase on top of it once it's merged

@natechicago your turn

@nicolas-grekas Since the new unit test depends on PHPUnit Bridge, should this PR (targed against 2.3) be closed and a new one opened against 2.7?

The bridge is used to test 2.3 also so this PR is fine. See my PRs from yesterday
