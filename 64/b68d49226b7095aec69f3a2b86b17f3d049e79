Hi there, it seems better to me :)

FYI using Symfony 4.3.0-beta1 (without the Twig fixes in `form_div_layout.html.twig`) here are the results:

Pre-patch:

```
Remaining direct deprecation notices (1)

  1x: Using an "if" condition on "for" tag is deprecated since Twig 2.10.0, use a "filter" filter or an "if" condition inside the "for" body instead (if your condition depends on a variable updated inside the loop).
    1x in EventControllerTest::testIndex from App\Tests\Controller\Admin
```

Post-patch:
