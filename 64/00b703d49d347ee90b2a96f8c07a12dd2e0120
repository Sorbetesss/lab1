ANSI codes are very "unreadable". So, what do you think changing code like this:

```php
// Erase the line
$this->output->write("\x1B[2K");
```

By something like this?

```php
$eraseLineCode = "\x1B[2K";

// ...

$this->output->write($eraseLineCode);
```

Or:

```php
$ansiCodes = array(
    'eraseLine' => "\x1B[2K"
);

// ...

$this->output->write($ansiCodes['eraseLine']);
```

Maybe in a separate PR?

We can write them as class constants, but what do you think about implementing a class to build escape sequences?

@alekitto Probably a very good idea but out of the scope of this PR.
