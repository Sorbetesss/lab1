But this is only a test, so it cannot be fixed, right?

@fabpot exactly it is a missusage, the test clarifies the way to achieve this

I don't get it. It he wants his attribute to be '1,2,3,4', it seems legitimate to me and it is clearly not a number.

@fabpot  he does not want a `1,2,3,4` which is a string humanly noticeable
he wants to imitate the `123,456` notation which pertains to numbers units, thousands, millions, billions, etc.
That notation is reserved to numbers only, therefore he must use a workaround with spaces. There is no harm on spaces he can later just use php ability to just parse it.

Seems fine, although it is madness that we allow "," as thousand separator in there at all IMO. I'd rather see this fixed, but I am not sure what this code is used for and what the impact would be.

How about you do an integer list and depending on the integers you have, they're either parsed as a string (integer list) or a float (thousand separators)? Sounds inconsistent and very error prone.

@fabpot @Seldaek after reading this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13553933/define-symfony-2-tag-attribute-as-an-array-in-xml-configuration now i understand what needs to happen, everything with `,` should be rendered as a string.
