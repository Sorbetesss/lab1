It would be great if someone else would step up and do some testing of this.

This doesn't seem to fix the issue. After testing this i recieved:
The Symfony\Component\Intl\NumberFormatter\NumberFormatter::parse() method's argument $position behavior is not implemented. Please install the "intl" extension for full localization capabilities.
