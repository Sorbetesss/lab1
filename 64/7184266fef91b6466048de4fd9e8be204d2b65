Can you please add a test covering the fix?

Ok, I will add it.
And I'm surprised to see current tests are not passing on Travis and I don't understand the errors. I'm not sure it's related to this PR, I will check.

Ok tests added.
And I rebased to get nicolas-grekas fix for fixtures so tests should pass now.

AppVeyor is not passing :(
but seems not related to this PR
