Hey!

I think @GromNaN has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Does this handle properly values containing backslashes or spaces ? see #43664 for the bash completion

If it can help, there was a fish plugin for Symfony 2: https://github.com/mojoLyon/fish-sf

Rebased onto 6.1, and seams to work. At least "on my machine" ;)

Does it work with the following features:
- aliased command  #44461
- backslash in typed and completed values (for class names) #43664
