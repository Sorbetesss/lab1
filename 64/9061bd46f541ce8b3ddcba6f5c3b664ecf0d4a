@nicolas-grekas : The tests are ok, but not ok :/ Do you have an idea why travis is saying that the tests are not ok ?

Green tests are only for 2.x branches. master is not ready to be worked on...

Yep I saw, but we are almost there! :) Look at that https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/builds/45150843

Don't you think we could deactivate tests for 3.x in php 5.3 ?

@saro0h 5.3 and 5.4 were disabled previously because of the new minimum version, but this got lost because of the config refactoring done by @nicolas-grekas
