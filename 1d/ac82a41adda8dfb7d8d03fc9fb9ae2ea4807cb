I have also submitted https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/9924 to help point developers in the right direction via documentation.  **That PR does not document this change**, it just provides a different avenue to notify the developer about the potential issue.  Feel free to merge that instead of this (or merge both! :smiley:)
