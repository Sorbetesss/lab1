Why is it a KernelEvent? It's not triggered from the Kernel.

Well, it is dispatched from the [`HttpKernel::terminate()` method](https://github.com/symfony/http-kernel/blob/8712724038f8e1c53da6f3a904d3511895232d5e/HttpKernel.php#L79).

True. But as discussed in #16342, the terminate event is always for master requests only. So exposing a `getRequestType` might just create more confusion. But for consistency I can see the value in this approach.

What do you think about overriding `getRequestType()` in `PostResponsEvent`, always return `HttpKernelInterface::MASTER_REQUEST` there and add a comment explaining the reasons? This way we will hopefully avoid confusion for people wondering why there is a `getRequestType()` method for this event.

@xabbuh the request type is set in the constructor. I don't think there's need to override `getRequestType()`.

I don't see how this could be confusing really.

ÃŽ suggest to add a phpdoc at the class level explaining that it always returns MASTER_REQUEST
