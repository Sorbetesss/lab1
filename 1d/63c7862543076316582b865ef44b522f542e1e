IMO, one PR was enough ^^

It's easier to press merge for 3 branches than to cherry-pick them afterwards tho. But happy new year!

@iltar we don't cherry-pick. the 2.3 branch gets merged into newer branch on a regular basis (and so on). This ensures that we never miss a patch which should go in all branches.
So merging different PRs for each branch means having duplicate commits doing the same in the history.

So this PR should be change to update the year only for components which are new in 2.6 (VarDumper and DebugBundle)
