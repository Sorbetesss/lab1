@blowski thanks for this contribution!  I'm afraid that there is a problem with your code: you use the short array syntax. This is obviously right for modern PHP code, but we decided to not use it on Symfony.

The reason is that our existing code uses the old array syntax and updating it would require a lot of work. If we don't update the old code but use the new syntax in the new code, the result will be a mess. so let's use the old syntax everywhere. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz I'm blaming that one on PHPStorm. Third time lucky!
