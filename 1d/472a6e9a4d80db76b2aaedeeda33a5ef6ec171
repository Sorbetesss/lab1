Is this good to go?

Edit: Actually, looking at https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/33875, I think it's missing:
- `Symfony/Component/Notifier/Transport.php` Factory class
- Framework extension entry and config change
- `Notifier/Exception/UnsupportedSchemeException.php` entry

Edit: Fixed

Because I updated from the 5.0 upstream branch, which was wrong, I had 600+ commits as diff, also causing GitHub to request reviews from code owners. My bad, I reverted that push.

@Jeroeny Can you rebase to get rid of the merge commit? Thank you.
