Build failures are unrelated to the change.

Should be added to Milestone 5.4, had the wrong target branch when i created the PR.

Hey!

I think @CesarScur has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

To reproduce i added a zip with the fix in vendor:
[test-47998.zip](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/files/9937590/test-47998.zip)
Just run `php testcommand.php` in root.

Output without the fix:
```
Progress bar having only one line:
Foo!
[----->----------------------]
=-=-=-=
Progress bar having two lines:
[----->----------------------]
Processing "foobar"...
============================
foobar
```

Output with the fix:
```

Progress bar having only one line:
Foo!
[----->----------------------]
=-=-=-=
Progress bar having two lines:
Foo!
[----->----------------------]
Processing "foobar"...
=-=-=-=
============================
foobar
```
