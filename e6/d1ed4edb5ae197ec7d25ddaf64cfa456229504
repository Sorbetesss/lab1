Works for me, but can you think of any other way that wouldn't involve a conflict?

The only other way I can think of would be to disallow FWB 6.4 by adding the conflict in WPB 5.4.

If the problem happen only with 2 datacollectors, would it be possible to add a specific conflict ?

FMB 6.4 has a conflict with worflow < 6.4, but allow console 5.4.. so i guess there won't be a problem with the new worflow profiler

What if we add a conflict on console < 6.4 on FMB ?
