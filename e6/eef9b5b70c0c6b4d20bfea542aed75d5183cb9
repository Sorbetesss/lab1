@lyrixx Do you have time to finish this PR and rebase it on 5.x? Thank you

Oups, yes. I'll do that ASAP

I added true support for XML (can't wait to remove this :p) + added tests
It should be OK now

BTW, Fabbot seems wrong:
```
in src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Tests/DependencyInjection/Fixtures/yml/php_errors_log_levels.yml
Non-string keys are not supported. Quote your evaluable mapping keys instead at line 4 (near "!php/const \E_NOTICE: !php/const Psr\Log\LogLevel::ERROR").
```
