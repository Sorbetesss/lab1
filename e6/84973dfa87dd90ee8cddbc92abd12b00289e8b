I'm not sure we can do this change as is: protocol-relative URLs have only a relative meaning.
What if I want to validate that an URL is not-relative, as this validation rule used to provide?
In a Web form, many won't want to accept protocol-relative URLs, isn't it?

@nicolas-grekas Good point. I see 2 possible ways to fix this:

1. Create a RelativeUrlValidator class
2. Add a option to the current validator that can enable or disable the check for relative URL's

I think option 2 is the better one. And to not break BC it should probably by default not allow relative URL's.

Let's go for option 2, with a default that doesn't change the behavior for sure.
Should be submitted as a new feature, so against 3.4.

Can you rebase this PR to get rid of the merge commit? Thanks.

@fabpot The PR has been rebased.

Moving to 4.1 as 3.4 is in beta, thus closed for new feats.

Could you please rebase against master ?
