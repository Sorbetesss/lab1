Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.2 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Hey!

I think @AndreasA has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

@marcelsiegert Not really sure why I got mentioned, The last thing I did was adjust the unique entity validator. It is part of the doctrine bridge but it wasn't really related to UUID or ULID types.

But I can take a look though, bu I cannot approve it anyway.

@AndreasA Looks like it's because you updated the DoctrineBridge CHANGELOG at some point ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Carsonbot should probably skip `.md` files when looking for potential reviewers.

@chalasr Ah. Yes, it would probably make sense to skip those.
But even if I would review it, someone else would need to approve it anyway, so carsonbot should probably also add at least one reviewer that could approve/merge the PR in addition as well.

You should be able to approve the PR. It's probably not looking green like project member approvals but it still matters to us, especially if the bot requested your review as it should mean you have some knowledge in this area (otherwise you can just excuse Carson for the noise and ignore them)

@chalasr ah. yes I just see it now. It was at a different position than I expected, I seldom had to approve PRs on GitHub, mostly gitlab. as I already reviewed it, it is fine. But as you mentioned I was actually only mentioned due the changelog entry üòÑ
