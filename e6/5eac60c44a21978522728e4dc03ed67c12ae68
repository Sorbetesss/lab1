I think #18058 is about deprecating the `$deep` parameter of `ParamterBag::get`, not deprecating the `Request::get` method.

@jvasseur yes you are right. But if we explain the deprecation as *"Finding deep items in ParameterBag::get() is deprecated since version 2.8 and will be removed in 3.0."* most people won't understand it. This is in fact a huge BC break for some people because, as @zdenekdrahos said in his issue, upgrading to 3.0 will break their controllers (because they use `$request->get('foo')` instead of `$request->query->get('foo')`).

@javiereguiluz `$request->get` isn't deprecated and still exists in Symfony 3. What is deprecated is doing something like `$request->query->get('foo[bar]', null, true)` instead of `$request->query->get('foo')['bar']`.

This got me really confused because I've seen 0 deprecation notices in 2.8 regarding the get method to fetch request and query parameters. I think @jvasseur is correct about simply that notation being deprecated and removed in 3.0.

@jvasseur I'm really sorry. You were completely right from the beginning. I've updated everything using your nice example. Thanks!
