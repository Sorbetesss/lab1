It's nice to have this feature back ... but I'm afraid it looks very ugly.

What if we use a style similar to the sub-requests?

![subrequests](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/28613273-3837bba0-71f2-11e7-97de-2d5a479e4353.png)

We could display the controller only in the Request tab, like this:

![controller](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/28613283-421f179e-71f2-11e7-945e-f58e9d41ac75.png)

Oh you find it ugly :( My bad I was proud of my work :D

Actually, my first attempt was what you proposed. And I found it ugly; jajaja.

Note: I moved the link on top of the tab name because the controller is related to the request / response et / etc. and not only the request.

What if we display the controller like this:

![controller-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/28614362-e051ca80-71f5-11e7-8b16-34697a410fbd.png)

And reduce the font-size of sub-requests controllers to 18px to display a better hierarchy:

![controller-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/28614379-ee0f0a98-71f5-11e7-8333-3db910b470b7.png)

WDYT? As you can see, I did not had to change the CSS, And I'm quite happy to not add special rules for this.
