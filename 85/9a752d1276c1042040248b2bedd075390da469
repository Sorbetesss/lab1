I am not familiar enough with the code-base to spot those. But as a rule of thumb, I would keep the current usages of `Filesystem::isAbsolutePath()` as it is a stronger check than `Path::isAbsolute()`

Can you please target ðŸŽ¯ 6.0, as we are not allowed to introduce experimental classes in an LTS version.

@OskarStark is correct. We cannot have experimental code in LTS. However, we can make this new class non-experimental. It is a well used class outside of Symfony as the PR description tells.

@theofidry, Do what you prefer.

Since this has already proven useful and itâ€™s not controversial, I vote for 5.4 with no experimental flag.

Please rebase :) We cannot merge PRs that contain merge commits

Is there a technical reason for that choice or is it just the process in place? Seems weird to have to rebase which requires  a force-push from the user and completely change the commits history (which messes up the GitHub discussions)

Yes, IIRC it's a limitation from the internal tool we use for merging, it doesn't play well with merge commits

Just adding my two cents: This PR (including its predecessor #30969) has been open for over two years (!). It's not very motivating for a contributor to have their work pending for so long, and then being asked to make small changes, rebases etc. every few months.

@theofidry rebased this 19 days ago. I think it would be a great appreciation of his work and endurance to merge this, rather than waiting again, asking for another rebase, adding more nitpick comments etc.
