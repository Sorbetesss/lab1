You forgot the PR description: http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html#make-a-pull-request

Then the file was valid, see [the spec](http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/index.html#indentation%20space/)

this should go in 2.3 to avoid the pain when merging between branches

let me see if i can pick it up with gush and rebase it to 2.3, or does gh can do this without me worrying about further?

you don't need to worry (if you do the rebase yourself, it would require creating a new PR to change the target)

i will leave it as it is now then.
