How could we ensure that strict CSP compliancy is preserved on the long run?

Toggling to Need Work : I will disable CSP when browsing profiler pages and will introduce nonce only for toolbar injection.

@nicolas-grekas you asked this question. Checking if the injected script has the appropriate nonce, headers are included and rendered toolbar include nonce should be alright.

I've rename the PR to reflect that it only addresses the `unsafe-inline` topic. I think the PR now needs review
