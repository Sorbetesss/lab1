the `%s/%w` trick is for linux vs windows (the file path exceeded the table length on windows).

i missed the failing test from the original PR: https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/510860372#L5020 ..., not sure what happened.

It passed before, maybe related to the last minute changes: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/30666/files#diff-4d7446f0cdc9d06df82e038e443e1dbcL184 (removing VarDumper fallback in the component and bumping the deps)
