Wouldn't we violate PSR-11 if we upcast `ServiceNotFoundException`?

Sorry, I'm not sure to understand ; can you develop ?

Currently PSR\Container\ContainerInterface have the following phpdoc:
```
interface ContainerInterface
{
    /**
     * Finds an entry of the container by its identifier and returns it.
     *
     * @param string $id Identifier of the entry to look for.
     *
     * @throws NotFoundExceptionInterface  No entry was found for **this** identifier.
     * @throws ContainerExceptionInterface Error while retrieving the entry.
     *
     * @return mixed Entry.
     */
    public function get(string $id);
}
```
So, to be PSR, Symfony should only throw NotFoundExceptionInterface and ContainerExceptionInterface.

Currently, since Symfony allows to throws `\Exception` in the Container::get method,  in my understanding the Symfony Container doesn't fully respect the PSR interface.

The introduced `ServiceLoadingException` implements `ContainerExceptionInterface` so it will now respect the PSR interface.
