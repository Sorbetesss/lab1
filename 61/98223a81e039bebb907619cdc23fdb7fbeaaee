Not sure that failed build is related to the changes...

Let's ask some heavy users of Ajax requests (like @ostrolucky) what do they think of this proposal. I "remember" that in the past we did the opposite change ... but I'm not sure at all. Thanks!

I don't remember this being at bottom ever

@ostrolucky this behaviour was at the first (light) profiler design with symfony <=2.7

The past change was done in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17457, based on discussion in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/16831

btw, your GIF shows that you are reintroducing the behavior which was asked for removal: having to scroll to be able to see the latest requests.

@stof missed that one. Is this the only reason?

I think that would be best. It mimics behaviour of browser network inspectors
