Can you explain a bit more the situation when it happens?

@fabpot, it happens when you have `Request::setTrustedHeaderName(Request::HEADER_CLIENT_IP, '');`. Then `InlineFragmentRenderer` adds `HTTP_` key to `$server`.

@lazyhammer Of course, I can see that in your code, but why would you set the trusted header name to an empty string?

@fabpot I would do that, if I want to trust other proxy headers (f.e. proxy-port), but not the client-ip. And replacing the name with an empty string (or other false value) is the way to accomplish that.
