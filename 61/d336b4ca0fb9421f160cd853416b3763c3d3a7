Removing the event channel should probably not be harcoded, but moved to the default configuration in Flex/Symfony SE.

@fabpot is there a (hacky) way in twig to check if profiler_dump exists? Can we think of one? :)

edit: a wrapper in CodeExtension could do

Instead of complicating things with a new config option to make the list of excluded channels configurable, could we hardcode it? For our own log channels this is correct (event is annoying but the rest are useful). The only problem could be if users want to exclude some custom channels that are also annoying. I'd say: let's not implement that unless a significant number of people ask for it.

Maybe we could detect if all the informations from the context are used in the message an hide the context in those cases ?

Why do we care about _event_ channel, to be excluded here, actually? What we need are [filters](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/24263) right?

Profiler doesnt do this AFAIK.

ping @javiereguiluz should we move this to 4.1?

Moving to 4.1.

To not add a hard dependency on VarDumper, I propose a different implementation: the log context is dumped according to what you have installed.

If your app has VarDumper, you see this:

![var_dumper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/37975536-dbce0f00-31df-11e8-8eab-f1a0023b5402.png)

If your app has Yaml, you see this:

![yaml](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/37975553-e1ca1d7c-31df-11e8-8a2a-f79b9f175e76.png)

Otherwise, you see this:

My question ... should we complicate this so much ... or should we just always use `json_encode()` which works reasonable well in all cases?
