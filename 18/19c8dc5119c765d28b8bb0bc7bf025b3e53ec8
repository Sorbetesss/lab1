The LF previous to `return` statement is missing, try to apply the suggested patch:
```
curl https://fabbot.io/patch/symfony/symfony/26403/33f80b7659a3b757f791b5fa7ced534c0b9a06f2/cs.diff | patch -p0

#24447 made some cleanup to other places where `createDateTime()` was used. Shouldn't we change the `updateTimestamp()` method similarly instead?

We should indeed

@xabbuh many thx, so using `new \MongoDB\BSON\UTCDateTime()`  instead of the method is the real fix ?
going to update my PR

i am pretty confident, that the changes in this particular pr have nothing todo with the failing build in appveyor, anything i can do to fix this?

@nicolas-grekas could you check why the test about prepared command is failing on Appveyor ? is it a volatile test ?
