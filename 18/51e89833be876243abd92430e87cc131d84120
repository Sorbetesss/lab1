For now there are failing 5 tests with `Invalid HELLO reply, Redis Server version may be too old (RELAY_ERR_COMPAT; commands.c:6660)`. I'll need to investigate a bit more of time to that or maybe someone else has an idea.

I suppose we should merge this on 5.4?

@nicolas-grekas yes, i didn't check this, in the issue was mentioned the 6.3 branch. Is it possible to handle this during the merge or should I rebase it?

Please submit another PR for 5.4, I'll use this one when merging up.
