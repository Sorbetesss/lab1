Does it make sense to dispatch stopped event? Raising exception here seems more appropriate.

I don't think so, because it will make userland code harder to write.

@lyrixx I think such case should add a log message in the traceable event dispatcher, as it could also be a mistake in the userland code (people not knowing that stopping the the propagation of the first event will impact the next event because they reused the same event object)

@stof Good idea. I added it.

How does error reporting make harder to write?

there is not error IMHO. see this for instance: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/11882/files#diff-6d1e8dc0d2c0e7c4ab206d0efbb71516R161
