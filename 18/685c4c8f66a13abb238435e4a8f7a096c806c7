In addition to the !is_array verification, verifying that it's a string should be added no?
What do you think about it ?

@AurelienPillevesse

When something other than a string is passed, the message seems rather explicit.

**_Argument #2 ($value) must be of type string, DateTime given_**

What do you think should happen if you don't have a string?
