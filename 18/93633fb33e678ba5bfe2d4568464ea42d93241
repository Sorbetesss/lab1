We addressed this issue by introducing a https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineCacheBundle
IMHO, since this is currently unusable, it should be removed. There's no way someone can use this class without experiencing E_FATAL.

@romainneutron : If I remove the type hint, we are not sure to have a `CacheProvider` (so not sure to have the method `deleteAll`).

@stof : I reverted the changes on constructor but I checked if the property `cache` inherits `CacheProvider`.

OK, :+1: for the current PR to avoid the E_FATAL

OK, so we agree: I never pushed a BC! ;)
