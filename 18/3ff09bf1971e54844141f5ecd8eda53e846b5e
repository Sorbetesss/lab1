Bug report is for version `2.2`, shouldn't this go against `2.2` too?

nice, when someone says something like what @stloyd said, what is the approach? open 2 or 3 PRs with the changeset for each branch? or the maintainer would cherry-pick in case it is a clean merge? :baby:

@cordoval open one for 2.2 and fabien will merge it into 2.3 i think :)

nope, always open a PR on the oldest branch and I will then merge it to the newest one. By the way, this is documented.
