I renamed the method `willBeAvailable()` to hint that this is for checking the availability of symbols at runtime, not compile time.

that's indeed a good idea. But then, please check my review even if it is on an outdated diff due to the renaming.

@stof comments addressed. The method now takes a new argument that defines the parent dep of a dep, so that we can consider that a package installed to satisfy a dev-mode dep is available even if it is in dev-mode.
