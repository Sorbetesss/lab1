Any benchmark which shows the "drastic" improvements?

My quick test shows (removed container and pressed refresh a few times after it was rebuilt) about 300k lower memory usage (25,2M vs 25,5M) and about 10ms less load time in dev environment.. With this new commit.

Looks ok to me. But I don't see the drastic improvment. Can somebody explain please why this improves performance?
