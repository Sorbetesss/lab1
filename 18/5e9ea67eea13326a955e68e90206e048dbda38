I wonder if the implementation/configuration shouldn't be more complicated:
- 423, 425, 429, 503 => always
- 500, 502, 504, 507, 510 => idempotent only

Maybe:
ChainDecider
- StatusCodeDecider([423, 425, 429, 503])
- IdempotentStatusCodeDecider([500, 502, 504, 507, 510], [GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT]

failling test are related to Could not parse version constraint >=5.x: Invalid version string "5.x" And related to async-aws that should be fixed by https://github.com/async-aws/aws/pull/802

Let's settle on #38532 before merging (and rebasing) this one.
