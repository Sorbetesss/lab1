> I have not added type for methods with @inheritdoc annotation, should I?

yes please if possible

> Don't we want to type also functions without @return annotation? (still in final classes)

yes, when possible too (i.e. only one type is returned)

> If yes is the answer of the previous one, do we also want the void return type?

I don't think void provides much benefit so I would suggest to not added, that will save us from some merge conflicts.

> I have also added the return type in the DependencyInjection PhpDumper, but is it also wanted?

At least not in this PR to me, see my comment on it.

> Should we update the documentation's code samples when they display final classes?

sure
