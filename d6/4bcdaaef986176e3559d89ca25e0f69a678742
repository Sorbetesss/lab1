This is a fantastic DX improvement! Thanks @yceruto.

Thanks for that feature!

The other idea for solving this would be to somehow show the number of children errors in parents (maybe with different color than red).

I just rebased! All tests in green again :smiley:

@eXtreme would be another solution but in that case we would have to open each node until the form with error. In this way the form error is in sight :eyes:  ;)

@eXtreme @yceruto why not both?

I've found a pain point to make this https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/19339#issuecomment-231966139 proposal:

Suppose you have a form with two children, where one of them has the [`error_bubbling`](http://symfony.doc/reference/forms/types/form.html#error-bubbling) property to `true` and both children have an error, right now, the result will be:

```
- form [1]
    - child1 <--- error_bubbling = true, so the error is passed to parent form
    - child2 [1]
```

If we implement this proposal, the result will be:

```
- form [1][1]
    - child1
    - child2 [1]
```

Which would be confused IMO, still when we put different colors.

WDYT ?

@yceruto : I was for both proposals, but I came to the same point you did. So IMHO, your solution is enough. But if we wanted to improve this a little bit, I'd say that's not the number of errors in children forms which is important, but rather showing the path to the error. This is what you do by expanding all nodes with errors, but why not simply highlighting in red the full path ?

```diff
- form // some children contain errors, red
    - child1 // No error, grey
-   - child2 [1] // Has error, red
```

I like your proposal @ogizanagi I say let's do it.

I've updated the result screenshot with highlighting error path feature, thanks to @eXtreme, @apfelbox and @ogizanagi by the idea :+1:
