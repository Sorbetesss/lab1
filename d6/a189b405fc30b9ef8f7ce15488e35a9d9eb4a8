:+1: except your last test being very difficult to read.

Perhaps you could organise lines by BC first, then by expanded or multiple.
Rephrasing might help like :
"If placeholder is null", "If placeholder is false and empty_value is empty" ...

The fix looks good, but do we really need so many test fixtures? Can we reduce them to the bare minimum?

@xabbuh the (admittedly extensive) test data were invaluable in that they revealed when the fix was finally correct after a number of failed attempts. Surely, one datum for each possible permutation *is* the bare minimum.
