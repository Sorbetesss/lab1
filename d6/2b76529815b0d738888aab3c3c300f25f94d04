applies to rowspan as well.. looking at it.

too bad.. the trick doesnt seem to work in that case

ie this one still fails;
```php
$table = new Table($output);
$table->setRow(0, array(new TableCell('f<error>o'."\n".'o</error>o', array('rowspan' => 2)), 'a'));
$table->setRow(1, array('b'));
$table->render();
```

edit: the same trick does work at first sight.. but breaks tests (e.g. `Cell with rowspan and colspan contains new line break`).

edit2: all good now :)

Agree. Had to add a tiny new feature as well.
