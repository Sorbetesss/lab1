The UPGRADE-2.8.md and 3.0 file should be updated with instruction on how to upgrade.

I added entries in the UPGRADING files and hope that's what you expect.

@fabpot Anything else you'd like to see changed? Once this is merged I'd like to continue discussing #15719 and #7796, both would need to be addressed in 2.8/3.0 because of deprecations/removals.
