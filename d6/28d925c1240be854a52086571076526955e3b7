Seems it is cover my case, but not cover all cases. For example this one: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ewgRa/2a71d44329be2be6446e/raw/733b5baf2b18e42149a670e92e0a27b87ff27567/gistfile1.txt

@ewgRa The keys you pass in the `choices` array need to be unique. You can map those keys to labels by using a closure in the `choice_label` option though. The closure accepts the current `$choice`, `$key` and `$value`. Use `$key` (i.e. the key in the `choices` array) to access the corresponding label and return it from the closure.

@webmozart at least my case this PR solve.

Maybe good idea to document it, or add checks in cases like I show at gist.
