Is it something that needs to be merged in an older branch instead?

I considered this a new feature. I don't remember your policy for supporting new PHP versions features.

Right now, we add support for newest PHP versions in the lowest maintained version, that's why I'm asking.

I need to rebase on 4.4 then, do you agree?
