What about null values?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@ostrolucky I think it should do nothing for null values. I will add a condition and a test.

I think we could save plenty of code here if the constraints were just specialised versions of the already existing `Range` constraint. WDYT?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2018-09-30T18:43:57Z

like `Positive extends Range`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2018-09-30T19:02:16Z

yes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Better fit is GreaterThan*/LessThan*. No new validators would be required then

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2018-09-30T19:05:53Z

indeed, those fit better than `Range`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@ostrolucky Do you mean we don't need the new `Positive*/Negative*` validators at all and users should use the already existing `GreaterThan*/LessThan*` validators?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@xabbuh @ro0NL I changed the `PositiveValidator` which is now extending the `GreaterThanValidator`. Is this what you had in mind?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2018-10-05T09:22:20Z

@jschaedl actually i expected it like:

```
class Postive extends GreaterThan {
   public function __construct() {
       parent::__construct(array('min' => 1));
   }
}
```

then `Postive` is validated by `GreaterThanValidator` as regular.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep, like @ro0NL says. Well, not exactly (validatedBy needs to be specified and minimum value maybe tweaked) but mostly just that.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2018-11-16T13:31:21Z

IMHO it should, so we get the expected exception here https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Constraint.php#L136

Also we could make `message` the default option for these :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ostrolucky at 2018-11-16T14:26:08Z

These constraints are designed in a way they will never pass `null` to parent.

It would make some sense in case message is default property, but I don't think somebody would approve such change.

@jschaedl could you please send a Docs PR for this new feature?
Thank you

@OskarStark I am already working on it. :-)
