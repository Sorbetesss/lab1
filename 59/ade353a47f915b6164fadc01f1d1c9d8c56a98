what happens if you defined ``array('fr', 'en')`` as fallback locales and you load either fr or en as fallback locales. what would be the fallbacks for each of them ?

@stof
fr -> en as fallback
en -> fr as fallback

well, this looks weird to me though, as the fr fallback of en will be different from the fr catalogue used anywhere else. But it is indeed one of the possible implementations. the other one could be to consider that ``en`` does not fallback to anything here, as it is itself the last fallback locale.

Anyway it is a different topic (and a behavior change, so not for 2.3), so it should be discussed separately.
