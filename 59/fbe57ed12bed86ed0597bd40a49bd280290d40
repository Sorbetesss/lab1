I agree. Lets see first which should be considered a "primary" one, so that the other one can be deprecated/removed. However, both `rediss://` and `tls://` are used somewhat equally, `rediss://` being somewhat a better choice in case of Redis Cache Adapter where the adapter is actually being recognized [based on the DSN](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.x/src/Symfony/Component/Cache/Adapter/AbstractAdapter.php#L129).

Can you please rebase to get rid of the conflicts? Thanks
