@stloyd thanks for this *pull request*. I really like it!  The only thing that I'm not sure about is the date placeholders. You propose to use the following:

```jinja
<input type="text" name="start" id="start" value="{{ start }}"
       placeholder="i.e. {{ '-2days'|date('d.m.Y') }}">

{# ... #}

<input type="text" name="end" id="end" value="{{ end }}"
       placeholder="i.e. {{ 'now'|date('d.m.Y') }}">
```

In my opinion, using dynamic dates is **handy** but not always **helpful**. The problem with dates is that you never know if the first number is the day or the month. Take for example your screenshot: `07.04` is the 7th of April or the 4th of July?

I'm not sure about this but, do you think it could be better to replace the dynamic dates for *date format placeholderes* such as `dd.mm.YYYY`?

@javiereguiluz Really good point, and I must say that I was not sure what to put there, so I choose most common format I know =)

But taking your point I think that this version: `9th April 2014`, looks better than `dd-mm-YYYY` (or `dd.mm.YYYY`):

A placeholder like `9th April 2014` could make people think they have to type the whole month-names into the field... I like the format placeholder

`e.g. 9th April 2014` is correct whereas `e.g. dd-mm-YYYY` is not correct (dd-mm-YYYY is a format, not an example)

As Javier proposed, I'm much more in favor of using `dd-mm-yyyy` as a placeholder as developers understand it, and they would write a date using the correct format.

instead of placeholders for date inputs I would use input="date" in order to benefit the features offered by browsers and html5

Using a date input as suggested by @pborreli makes a lot of sense as all browsers used by developers probably support this anyway.

@stloyd Can you update this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fabpot Done, unfortunately we can't use only `date` type, it's not supported by IE & FF, so I have left those placeholders there with suggestion from @javiereguiluz (`dd.mm.YYYY`), also added usage of `url`, as it's support is much wider than that `date` type.
