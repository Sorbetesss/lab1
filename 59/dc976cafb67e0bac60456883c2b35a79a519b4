Coding standard issues are unrelated to my change, should I still apply them ?

@fabpot I added a short explanation and a link that reference this PR.

Also I will ask again, should I apply the suggested coding standard changes even if they are not related to my code ?

@fancyweb No, please ignore them.

Isn't this a bug fix?
