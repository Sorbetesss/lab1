The telegram tests are failing on CI with an error about an undefined key. Is it coming from that PR as well ?

I will check later

I cannot reproduce the missing key, I tried to composer update --prefer-lowest, but tests are still passing ðŸ¤”

Besides that, I think we should not write json and decode it, but write an array and encode it in the assertion. But that should be a floor up PR once green

@igrizzli any idea?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As far as @xabbuh and I can find out so far, dropping `symfony/http-client:^5.4` helps, so now we have the same errors in high and low deps test.

For the errors itself, maybe
* https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/49911

is related....

Thanks @xabbuh, looks like `symfony/mime` was missing
