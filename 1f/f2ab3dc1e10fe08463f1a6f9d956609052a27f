I would trim only when really needed. What makes trimming neeeded in the first place?

@fabpot Using a leading backslash will made the `instiateController method fail because it can find the class, according to #30045 (comment), I've update this method to trim when an leading blackslash is passed and to fix this behaviour.

You've changed a method that deals with errors, so this looks suspicious to me.

Okay I've misread the whole think, was only thinking about the comment, but hey, this is the right fix and I understand why is was deprecated. So maybe the even better fix is to deprecate using backslash like in the first PR that has been closed ;).

WDYT @fabpot ?

I think I still don't get the problem. Can you explain it to me again? Perhaps with an example?

IIUC, this PR fixes issues when defining routes like this:

```yaml
my_route:
    path: /whatever
    controller: \App\Controller\DefaultController
```

Not sure it's really common, but IMO this should be supported anyway
