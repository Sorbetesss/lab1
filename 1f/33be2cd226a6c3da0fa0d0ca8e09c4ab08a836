Isn't this the same as #17760?

@xabbuh indeed. But as for #17694 tests in 2.8 need FQCN or they will fail.
Once #17760 is merged, this PR will fix them.

What if someone uses `null`?

@iltar it returns an empty string as expected. But it was the same for `false` which caused these bugs.

#17760 has been merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is this one still needed?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-02-26T06:01:15Z

No let's close.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-02-26T06:05:24Z

But it would be more consistent with other tests. I missed the ping this should have been merged before #17886 :(

Will there be some conflicts ? I let you decide to close then.

I've rebased, it's up to you.
