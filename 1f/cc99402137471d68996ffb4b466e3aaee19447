We don't need it due to the experimental, but do we want a BC layer here?

üëç for adding BC layer

We don't need a BC layer, but we definitely need some documentation in the CHANGELOG to help people migrate their code.

Why not `messenger.default_bus`? So it's explicit that it's the default one.

We already have:
- `translator.default`
- `router.default`
- `cache.default_*`

Personally, I do like `messenger.default_bus`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd add a BC layer as well, especially given the fact we have all these one-word services in Symfony (`router`, `translation`, etc...)

The bc layer is a one liner: a deprecated alias should do it.

@ktherage can you do these two changes (BC layer + `messenger.default_bus`)?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@sroze i made the wanted changes but i'm not really sure that changes about the BC layer are those you wanted. Feel free to tell me what's wrong (on Slack i am more reactive because i get noticed as soon as i got a message).

@ktherage check the tests - one is failing now :)

@weaverryan yes sorry :sweat_smile:. i'll fix it.
