Updated to 2.7, reverted base `Extension`.

However, we could update built in bundles to bypass `Extension::getConfiguration` right? Initializing the configuration class explicitly per extension (like the framework bundle already does).

That should improve something.

This should be considered as a bug, isn't it? What about adding a test case?

Test added.

What about core bundles with different implementations regarding `getConfiguration`?

Then again, maye this should work vice-versa, updating bundles to consistently track resources from `getConfiguration` vs. keeping it as is.

I think moving the responsibility away from `getConfiguration` makes sense.

Im not sure.
