I don't think that it is a good idea to automatically display the information for the first service that looks similar as you won't notice that you made a mistake.

@xabbuh, what about to use the default value?
```php
$default = 1 === count($matchingServices) ? 0 : null;

return $io->choice('Select one of the following services to display its information', $matchingServices, $default);
```

@voronkovich sounds better

@xabbuh, I've changed the command behavior as I proposed below.
