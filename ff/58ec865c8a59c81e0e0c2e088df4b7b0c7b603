PR changed to be the first one of three. This one, on 2.7, simply ignores the extra options if the session is already started.

Once merged, I'll issue two other ones:
1. Instead of ignoring, we will send a deprecation on 3.4
2. Instead of the deprecation, we will throw an exception on 4.0

And when merged we should finally be able to get green tests with PHP 7.2 in #24516.

ðŸ‘‹ @symfony/mergers should we go ahead with this first PR for PHP 7.2 support (i.e. green tests) ?
