A reference to the symfony-demo project seems relevant :) If the demo is hosted live somewhere, linking to  this live hosted version would be awesome!

What about adding some badges about code coverage or build status?

@Wirone Fabien has always been against badges in the readme.

@javiereguiluz there is nothing talking about community reviews anymore. Is it intended ?

@stof ok, I didn't know. Just asking ;-)

Due to https://github.com/composer/packagist/issues/764, the rendering of the readme on Packagist will become weird with this new content, as it will remove the ``Installation`` here.
We should either keep a top-level title, or contribute a fix in Packagist.

Answering the pending comments:

@fbourigault I've added a mention to the Symfony Demo (in the docs section ... I can't find a better place)
@stof yes, let's remove the community reviews because it's a second-level information. We link to contribute code/docs, which is the important thing, and there we link to the community reviews, etc.
@Wirone we know that badges are popular, but for Symfony we decided that they don't provide much useful information.
@stof yes, let's fix the Packagist issue in their repository

So, we're good to go :)
