i wonder if the handling for different formats could be made more generic, ie. into a component of its own. @schmittjoh also created a lib for this once upon a time.

@lsmith77 the two way have their advantages. Here having a single `AttributeMetadata` gathering data both from properties and accessor methods make sense IMO: they match the structure of the serialized document and allows to keep the code clean and simple.

However, maybe some formats loaders related code from Serializer, Validator, Routing and Config can be merged (but not especially metadata). cc @webmozart @Tobion @fabpot @stof.

The loaders for the DIC and the Routing for instance share code (to be found in Config). I don't know if it would be worth it to go further down this road. Anyway, I think that's something that should be discussed independently of this PR.

@lsmith77 can I merge this PR or do you think this issue is blocking?

by lsmith77 at 2015-03-06T06:32:15Z

no. this was more a forward thinking point i made
