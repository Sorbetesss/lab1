Hey @tienvx nice to meet you. I've seen just seen your mbtBundle, Then I saw this https://github.com/tienvx/messenger-memory-transport repo on your github page and I remembered to have seen a PR about memory transport on symfony. And indeed it's you. Funny chain of exploration that let me came back here in the end. I always end here in symfony. I think I'm cursed ;)

Hello @Tobion nice to meet you too. I think because it's a small world :D btw, when this MR is merged, my repo https://github.com/tienvx/messenger-memory-transport can be archived

Fixed a code conflict, but test case failed after merging with branch 4.4. The test case failed is in `src\Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle`

Thanks for your review @Tobion . I updated the code. Please review again. Currently CI failed because of the Console component.
