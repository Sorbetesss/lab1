Are they opened by default? If so, can you add a limit of maybe 5 or 10 logs? I've had pages where there are 100+ logs and that will make it annoying to find the exception.

@iltar this PR is about fixing this page, ie make it work again; not about making it better. We could (and should) work on that for 3.3. But this one is a bug fix (placeholders are not replaced right now, and CSS needs a fix in the code block excerpt).

I mis-read the code as well. 👍
