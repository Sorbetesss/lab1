Doing that in 2.2 is a BC break.

you are removing the logger rather than maybe actually using the logger for some useful reasons, not sure which is best

Why is it a bc break? Its private property. Don't see how it can break.

@Tobion Right and as PHP does not care if you pass additional parameters, we should be fine.

yep, it would be more a bc break if we start actually logging messages in this class ^^
