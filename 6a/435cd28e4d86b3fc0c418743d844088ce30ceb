That's very hard to test and to catch all cases.
I've rebased the branch, but I'm not sure if it fixes the issue perfectly.

@GromNaN Thanks for your feedback. As your PR is an improvement over the current situation, I think it's safe to merge it as is. Perfection can be achieved later on... is possible at all.
