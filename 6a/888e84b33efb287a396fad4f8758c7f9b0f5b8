Please target 7.1. We usually don't merge performance improvements into LTS branches.

Shouldn't we now also implement the `ResetInterface` to prevent memory leaks?

If so, the `PhpDocExtractor` should implement it too, I guess.

If all we store is class metadata, we don't need a reset IMHO as the leak is upper bounded, and resetting might effect performance of long running kernels for little memory savings in the end.
