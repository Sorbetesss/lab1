All inherited methods are deprecated, except a few ones:

- ``Iterator`` methods, because the iteration is not deprecated (even though I will probably use ``IteratorAggregate`` to implement it when removing the SplObjectStorage inheritance in 3.0)
- ``count`` (we still want to implement ``Countable``)
- ``Serializable`` methods, which are totally broken and so I submitted #15906 to 2.3 instead

Should we now implement the desired interfaces explicitly so that we are aware of the fact that we need to ship custom implementations once we break the inheritance?

@xabbuh the only interfaces we need at Traversable and Countable. And we will notice it when rewriting the implementation, because most tests of the crawler are relying on them anyway.
