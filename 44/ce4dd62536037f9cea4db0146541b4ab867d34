For 2.8?

@xabbuh I never had this problem in Symfony 2.8 so I created this PR on the 3.4 branch but I can rebase on the 2.8 version if it can be backported to 3.4 after that.
I don't have any project in 4+ to test it.

Great first contribution!
I think this cannot go as is in 2.8 anyway, as we don't use the VarDumper component in profiler yet (only since 3.x). So this PR targeting 3.4 is fine.
