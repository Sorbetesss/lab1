Thank you for this PR. Could you elaborate why this is needed?

The `LocaleAwareInterface` from the 1.x contracts is incompatible with the type-hint that we added in #41568.

I noticed this while looking at the failing Travis build (see https://travis-ci.com/github/symfony/symfony/jobs/512360890#L9504). I have no idea why Composer installs this version of the contracts package on the CI, but for projects using the String component this is a real issue.
