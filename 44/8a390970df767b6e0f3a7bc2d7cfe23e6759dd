Tests need to pass of course, and new tests added to cover the behavior.
(note that I have no opinion yet on the behavior you're suggesting).

I just realised I've submitted to separate PRs as I was editing online. Silly me.

I'll do it properly and get rid of #19134 and #19135. But that'll have to be tomorrow.

@rquadling you should get rid of only one of them, and update the other PR to contain all changes

I've closed #19135. You can do the change directly in this PR now. No need to create yet another one.
