the idea was for e.g. vendors using `OptionsResolver` to opt-out from end-user deprecations themselves, i.e. the same reason why SF needs it.

So it's a feature .. kinda :)

Does this have to be at the `Options` level? Because sure, it also exists on `OptionsResolver` and it makes sense there.

I think yes, because that's what you typehint for:

```php
$resolver->setDefaults([
    'a' => function (Options $options) {
        $b = $options->offsetGet('b', false); // never triggers
        $c = $options['c']; // always triggers
    },
]);
```
