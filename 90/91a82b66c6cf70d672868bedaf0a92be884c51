What about triggering a deprecation at least from the `SecurityDataCollector` in case a role does implement `RoleInterface` without extending `Role`?

@ogizanagi But such a role would have triggered the deprecation already because of the `@deprecated` annotation in the `RoleInterface` (at least in the `dev` environment).

Right. I forgot about this behavior.
