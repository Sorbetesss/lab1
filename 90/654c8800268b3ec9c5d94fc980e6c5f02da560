Can you check if the build failure is related?

Fixed fabbot, the CI test failures are caused by changes in PHP 8.2 upstream. You can see the same errors in e.g. https://github.com/symfony/symfony/runs/6146660539

Btw, let's mark PHP 8.2 tests as experimental again: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/46160

The benefit of using variadic was the type check enforced by PHP.
I'm really fine doing that but I'd suggest going one step further and allow only one argument: array|string $cases
When array, we should enforce that all cases have the same class.

It's actually `\BackedEnum|array`, I updated it.
