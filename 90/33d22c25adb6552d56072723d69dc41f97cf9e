NOTE: The build failed in the StopWatch Component. Not the Form component.

yes @ChristianGaertner it has been happening often, please go to travis and relaunch your run from there so it can be green and all good

@cordoval only contributor access people can relaunch the run afaik, so you have to do this

Thanks for triggering the rebuild!

This time a failure in the Process component. Anyone a clue?! I mean it's for sure not caused by this commit (as the previous build passed with the PHP version which just errored...)

don't worry about the build failure, @fabpot will discover it's not caused by this PR.
