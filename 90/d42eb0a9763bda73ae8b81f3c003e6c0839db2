What about `@app.configurator:configure`? I would prefer keeping the `@` as a service indicator.

As far as I understand correctly, this continues #12008 that missed the "configurator" case?
Could you add a few tests please?

@ro0NL, I would prefer to use `@` too. But it will be a BC break.

I see. Maybe it's good to mention this is a generic format, ie i thought it was configurator specific at first, but it's also a notation we can use on factories.

The BC is due the fact service id's allow for colons? Im not sure how intuitive this (new) format will be..., what about `@app.configurator->configure` =/ Anyway is this really better than
`['@app.configurator', 'configure']` which is pretty short already imo. We gain 5 chars or so...

@ro0NL, it is not a new format. It will be a BC break because some people already use short syntax for service factories in their code without using leading `@`.

@voronkovich I don't understand what you mean. ``app.configurator:configure`` does not work for a configurator today, because it is not a callable

I'm :+1: for making the configurator configuration support the same short syntax than the factory one in Yaml. Being consistent is a good idea

@nicolas-grekas, do we really need additional tests for this? We already have the tests for services factories: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Tests/Loader/YamlFileLoaderTest.php#L157

@voronkovich if there is a new supported syntax, we need to have a test ensuring that we don't break this syntax by mistake

@stof, Thanks for the explanation! @nicolas-grekas, I've added the tests and fixed some errors.
