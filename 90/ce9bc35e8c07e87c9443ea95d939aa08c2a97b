Returning an int doesn't respect the description of what the message is supposed to do:

> This method should always return the same base URL for a given path.

Ah, I missed this. It should be
> This method should always return the same base URL offset for a given path.

I don't know if "offset" is the best word, IMO "index" is better.

I don't mind changing "offset" into "index". @xabbuh WDYT? Should I make change and squash commits?

index sounds better

@xabbuh @fabpot Changed 'offset' to 'index'.
