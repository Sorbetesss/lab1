It should not be an exception but a notice of some kind. See symfony/symfony-docs#4265

I agree that it should not be an exception. Not having any listener registered does not mean it is a failure

Thanks, I didn't know there was an initiative for console style, this is great. I should wait for https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/12035

@matthieuauger Any news on this PR?

I was waiting for https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/4265 but it seems to be dead.
I'll quickly update this PR to display a standard notice instead.

I updated the PR to display a message instead of an exception. I followed the Console Style Guide for the formatting. Any feedbacks welcome

The PR is currently headed to master, but I think it should be merged in 2.6. Tell me if you want me to create another PR
