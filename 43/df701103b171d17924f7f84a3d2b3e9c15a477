Note to merger: line 32 with `choices_as_values` can be removed in 3.0+.

Indeed, in 3.0+ the FQCN string representation could be replaced with the `class` constant of each class.

@phansys It may not be necessary as that would mean to add the corresponding `use` statement...

IMO, it would be better to import the classes with `use` instead of hardcoding the FQCN, which could lead to typos and haven't IDE support. Obviously, I'm talking about the real use cases, not about those examples, in which I think you can use `FQCN::class` syntax.

I'm fine either way :)
