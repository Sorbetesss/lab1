Seems reasonable to me.

Looks good to me. We probably need to add tests for the edge cases and I think it should be done on the 2.1 branch instead.

@fabpot I've split the things for 2.1 into #8080 and added tests as good as possible.
This PR only has events stuff that was introduced in 2.3. So please merge this into 2.3 instead of master.
