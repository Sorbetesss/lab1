:+1: What about doing that on 2.3 as this is a bug fix? (no need to create another PR, as we can easily switch the branch when merging)

Sure. I have just realized that version 2.3 has not yet reached its end of life. My bad.

:+1: I think the normalization should only be done internally when really necesssary to work with it (e.g. in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Component/Filesystem/Filesystem.php#L332 ) which does not seem to be the case here.
