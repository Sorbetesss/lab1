Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "7.1".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

The `separator` option is only available in the Twig template, so I've kept this behavior for this new option. Should I add them so that they're both accessible from the form builder to maintain consistency (like `label` / `label_html` and `help` / `help_html`)?
