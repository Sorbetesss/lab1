Should we also allow `null`? The `action` attribute is optional for forms, right? So maybe we could pass `null` to tell Symfony to not add it.

I'm not sure because by default we have an empty string : https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Core/Type/FormType.php#L191-L193
Infact, I had `null` in one of my forms and it causes a typing error not very clear to identify where the problem comes from.

Side note: this should target 3.4 as bug fix IMO

@HeahDude I don't know, it could be cause a BC no ?

The BC break would also happen in master, every bug fix is some kind of BC break since it changes a wrong behavior. The question is do we consider it a bug? I do, but I also agree that casting null to string should be ok. Though, targeting master would mean deprecating passing null first in 5.1, and throw an exception in 6.0 only.

+1 for 3.4 as bugfix
