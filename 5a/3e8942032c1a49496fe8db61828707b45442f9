Hi @dunglas, Anymore work to do here?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Could someone point me how to fix the broken tests on PHP 7.1? I didn't find out how these last changes has impacted on other SF components.

Failures look unrelated with your changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice. Thank you.

@tsantos84 Can you rebase this PR to get rid of the merge commits (this is a requirement before I can merge)? Thank you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fabpot, I've got all this commits after rebasing the branch. Is this the expected result? Sounds weird for me. I've never use rebase before to be honest.

Github had bad moments exactly when I've tried to call you to help me with rebase. I think its better to create a new branch and cherry pick only the necessary commits.

@tsantos84 I have rebased your PR. Can you double-check that I didn't mess up anything?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tsantos84 at 2018-11-03T15:04:45Z

All commits are there. Many thanks for help me in this PR.

It could be worth to add an entry to the component's changelog file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@tsantos84 could you please add a note in the changelog file of the component as suggested by @xabbuh?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tsantos84 at 2018-12-02T15:40:59Z

Sure. Which version should I reference?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tsantos84 at 2018-12-03T18:07:40Z

@nicolas-grekas?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by chalasr at 2018-12-12T18:03:16Z

@tsantos84 4.3.0 is the target here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tsantos84 at 2019-01-18T10:30:12Z

Done, @dunglas. Sorry for the very long time since your request for these changes.
