I preferred to use the "v1.44.0" tag instead of master because they recommend it, since there may be json format changes in the future.

Maybe you prefer that I use master branch and this script fails, if format changes.

Great! Can you apply fabbot's patch? Also, can you run the script to see the diff with what we have now?

Thanks for working on this.
About my comments above related to ordering, maybe we should send them to the upstream db?
