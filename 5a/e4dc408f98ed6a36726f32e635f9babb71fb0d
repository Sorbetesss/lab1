Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.3 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

@Saladeuh thanks for this. It's a good idea to improve accessibility like this.

The problem is that in this PR you've removed all the new icons that we added in the profiler redesign (see #47148) and you used the legacy icons. So, please update this PR to add the `<title>` to the new icons. Thanks.

Thank @javiereguiluz ! I'm sorry, I modified the icons from a 5.4 project. It would be better now.
