I know the name of the proposed attribute is inline with the `#[IsGranted]` one and I'm fundamentally fine with it, yet I'm wondering if some more imperative name wouldn't read better  e.g. `#[ValidateCsrfToken]`, `#[ValidCsrfToken]`  or even `#[RequireValidCsrfToken`. Thoughts?

`#[HasValidCsrfToken]` ?

@chalasr it's more inline with the `AbstractController` helper function `->isCsrfTokenValid()`, like the `#[IsGranted]` is with `->isGranted()`

Sounds valid to me :+1: (I honestly didn't know we had this helper method in the abstract controller)

@yguedidi Can you have a look at the tests, they seem broken by this PR.

Let's go with the name then 👍🏻

Thanks for the explanation ℹ️

@fabpot Indeed low deps unit tests are broken by this PR!
I checked and I'm wondering what is the right fix.
Issue is that SecurityBundle will install security/http 6.4, so without the new listener.
Should I just upgrade the requirement to 7.1 or conditionally add the service if the class exists? or something else?

You need to bump the minimum version in SecurityBundle.

@fabpot SecurityBundle tests now pass! other failures seems unrelated
