@Seb33300 I have now cherry-picked your commit from #23690 and updated the tests. Thank you for the initial work on it.

`deps=high` jobs will pass once the changes are in `master`

Maybe I misunderstood but if I didn't fixed the test on my previous PR it's because regarding the comments I thought we had to introduce this as a new optional feature (with a new option).

But maybe I am wrong

@Seb33300 I think we should revisit the decision made back then. This only improves the rendering. Adding an extra option for this seems to be unneeded complexity.

Back then the PR was not completed, so we didn't make any decision :)
