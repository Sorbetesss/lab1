you should be using the RequestStack instead

Yup I was considering it. But in this case, on which request should we test the value? The last one, or on the master request?

the current one IMO

Hum, I think this would break, as currently, forms can not be passed in the subrequest.

Take an ESI, for example. The post data is not transmitted in the sub-request in this case.

So let's go with the master request. :)

@csarrazi well, the data bound on the form are not coming from the master request either

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by csarrazi at 2014-05-16T13:58:15Z

Ok. Let's go for the current request.
