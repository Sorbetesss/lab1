Why failed?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@ergiegonzaga there is a minor problem in one of the XML files. This is how you can solve it:

1) Open the `src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Resources/translations/validators.tl.xlf` file.
2) Remove the `+` contained at the beginning of each line.
3) Save the changes, commit the changes (`git commit src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Resources/translations/validators.tl.xlf`) and push the changes.

Ahh okay sir , thanks

Sir? why does it failed again this time? what's the problem?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@ergiegonzaga there are some problems which are unrelated to your changes ... but there's still a super minor problem with your pull request. The last line of the `validators.tl.xlf` file contains an extra `+` at the beginning of the line.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ergiegonzaga at 2018-02-10T11:36:32Z

Sir, why does it failed again? I already removed the last (+) sign.

@ergiegonzaga good news, I rebased and squashed your PR on latest master (using the `git rebase -i` command) and this is now green.

@nicolas-grekas Translations should always be merged in the lowest maintained branch (2.7 right now) even if some translations don't exist in 2.7.

@ergiegonzaga looking at other pending PRs, this failure seems not to be related to your changes so you shouldn't be worried.
