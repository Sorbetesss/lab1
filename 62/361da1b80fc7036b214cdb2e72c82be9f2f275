Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.4 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Not sure why PHPUnit tests fail, some issue with MongoDB or something?! Have not touched anything :_)

You can ignore test failures that are unrelated to you changes.

Still the same. Please revert your changes to the `.gitignore` file and remove your `.idea` folder from the PR, please. We cannot merged your PR with all that noise in there.

There's still a change in the `.gitignore` file (missing new line at EOF). Revert that file too, please. The language file must be the only file changed by this PR.
