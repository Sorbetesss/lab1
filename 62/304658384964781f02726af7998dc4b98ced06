New iteration: I've replaced the default templates by a theme. One can set a default theme (`setDefaultTheme()`, this is configurable globally in the `mailer.yaml` file) and/or set a theme for one email via `theme()`. I've also renamed the default Zurb theme to reflect the change and to allow adding more.

I've also changed the naming scheme so that we can add more built-in templates over time (`notification` being just the first one).

I think  this one is ready now.
