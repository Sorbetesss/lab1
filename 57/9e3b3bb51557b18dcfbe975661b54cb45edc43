Looks goodðŸ˜€
btw would "TelephoneType" be better to be named "TelType" in accordance with type-name of html5 tag? (I'm not familiar with English, so not sure the abbr like "tel" is common used though.)

Oops, I've just missed the review-comment by @ro0NL. Never mind this comment.

my reasoning; tel === telephone, so TelephoneType is explicit/verbose. In my domain i'd also call this field `$user->telephone`, not `$user->tel`.

Needs rebase to fix the conflict. (Let's keep `TelephoneType` btw, in case there is still debate)

@ogizanagi @fabpot rebased with 3.4 (sorry for the delay)

@apetitpa Can you have a look at the tests, they seem to be broken by your changes.

@fabpot It's done, it's green again. Travis 7.1 failing test will be fixed when merging.

@nicolas-grekas It's done but I still have one concern regarding the name of the `TelephoneType` class. Should we keep this name or use the original suggested name which was `TelType` as the HTML input type

If HTML5 is fine with "tel", so am I.

@nicolas-grekas Done, reverted to `TelType` as agreed
