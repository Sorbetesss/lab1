Should/Can we update `string|array` to `string|iterable` PHPdoc in StyleInterface etc?

These methods are not part of `StyleInterface`, but `OutputInterface` which is already up to date. The `StyleInterface` methods are unchanged.

(I'm not convinced enabling support for iterables in `StyleInterface` methods is worth it, appart maybe `listing` but there is already an `array` typehint).

`StyleInterface` could benefit the same upgrade (we could yield the lines from `createBlock()`).

Well we did it for `write()` why not `success()` and such =/ I agree it's probably less common to use here :sweat_smile:

I don't see many use cases for generators when displaying blocks, title, sections, etc... while `write/writeln` are important to update because the `SymfonyStyle` can be passed along to any method/class requiring an `OutputInterface` and that could really benefit from generators memory saving.
