I'm not sure we should go that far in BC, especially since this is non serializable data (since we're talking about consts used in static props only.)
I'd suggest to wait for an actual bug report before adding this, if any.

The thing is we even advised to use these strings in the previous docblocks of [`getClientIp()`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.2/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.php#L823-L825), [`getPort()`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.2/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.php#L930-L931), [`isSecure()`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.2/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.php#L1147-L1149) and [`getHost()`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.2/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.php#L1172-L1173).
