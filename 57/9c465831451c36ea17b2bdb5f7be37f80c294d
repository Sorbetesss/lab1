Cannot be merged into 2.3

Ok, I wondered about that - I guess it is a new feature.  Do I need to re-submit?

This should indeed go into master.

Ok, is it difficult for a merger to merge this into master or should I open a new PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it can be moved automatically without conflict. This can has not changed in later releases IIRC

:+1:

Please add a test for this, then I'm :+1: for merge into master

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK. Will add.

It looks like there are no tests for this class. Or am I missing something?

I added tests for `Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Controller/ControllerResolver` - should cover this and all existing scenarios.
