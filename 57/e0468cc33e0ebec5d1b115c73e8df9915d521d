Ping @symfony/deciders - this is totally subjective, but we should decide either way.

Would it be possible to change `load` to be public and return a new builder instance? That way it would support both type of usage (mutable,immutable)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@henrikbjorn The `import` method *does* return the new `RouteCollectionBuilder` - so you could still mutate it after it's been added:

```php
$adminRoutes = $routes->import(__DIR__.'/config/admin.yml', '/admin');
$adminRoutes->setDefault('_locale', 'fr');
```

Is that what you're after? Btw, I saw your [Muse](https://github.com/henrikbjorn/Muse) test app - thanks for testing things.

@weaverryan almost, i can think of cases where i want the "old" behavior where it isnt automatically added. That is what i want `load()` to do, and have import be load & mount.

No problem :)

@henrikbjorn What's your use-case for that? Obviously making `load()` public is trivial, but we want to keep the public API as small as possible.

If i wanted to build something using this class by itself then it would be a good idea to have a immutable option of loading routes. But maybe i am grasping for straws (thats a thing right?)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@henrikbjorn Ha, it is a thing ;). I still don't quite understand the mutable versus immutable thing and what use-case you're thinking of. But not necessarily because what you're asking doesn't make sense - I may just need more info. Can you give a code example of what you might want to accomplish that isn't possible/easy with the current interface? Would the change in this PR improve things, or not matter?

The change currently does exactly what is was assuming it would do eg `$builder->import('@MuseBundle/Resources/routing/routing.xml')` :+1:

I see an inconsistency in method signatures:

```php
function import($resource, $prefix = '/', $type = null)
function mount($prefix, RouteCollectionBuilder $builder)
```

I perceive `$resource` and `$builder` as similar things in this context. They both define a set of routes.

@GromNaN I don't understand, what would you change?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by weaverryan at 2015-11-11T16:26:19Z

Btw, if we're going to merge this or make any other changes... it needs to happen... like yesterday :). So any constructive :+1: , :-1: or specific changes would be ideal

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by henrikbjorn at 2015-11-11T19:40:45Z

@weaverryan he wants the $builder to be the first argument to mount, which makes sense to me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

:+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by weaverryan at 2015-11-19T15:50:17Z

I'd still like to see this merged - as I was just thinking how `import()` for all other loaders (e.g. `YamlFileLoader`) actually imports the configuration, whereas here it really just "loads" and returns it.

@symfony/deciders can we either close or merge this?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change makes it more understandable what happens :+1:
