>  I think better to exclude values only instead of excluding fields at all

Could you elaborate on why it's better?

In this case it represents browser's behavior - element is accessible (e.g. by JS), but server will not get values on form submit. (if I understand right that `Form:: getValues()` is same as form submit in browser)

The way this is currently implemented could be understood as a new feature because it's adding a new method. If we can do without the new method, that'd be better to qualify as bugfix.

Shouldn't the `$fields` be *not* populated with tags inside template instead?

this should indeed be implemented when populating the list of fields, as the form in the DOM does not have this field in this case in a browser. It is not only about the submission skipping the values.

Tests should also be updated to test that the Form does not contain the corresponding field at all (`has` returns false for this field name)
