Thank you @OskarStark for this PR.

We cannot merge this since it is a BC break. I had a better look where this is used, and I can see that nowhere do we handle the scenario where this method returns null.

I switched it to `5.x` 👍

I think the way to fix this is to deprecate the method and to add a new one with the correct syntax. But Im not sure it is worth the trouble.

What is the reason you want to tighten this?

As this is experimental, we can break BC in a minor release, thats why I now target `5.x`

Im not in my usual game today. I've been wrong twice in the same PR. I can admit that my mouse was even hovering the close button.

Im currently extra happy that Im not the only reviewer.
Thank you again Oskar for your work.

Sure, like this?

    "conflict": {
        ...
        "symfony/infobib-notifier": "<5.3",
        "symfony/mattermost-notifier": "<5.3",
