Could this go into 2.3?

I've pulled against 2.3 here - #10270.

@GrahamCampbell there's no need for a separate PR for 2.3. It's actually not recommended as we'd get conflicts later on.

The current PR can be merged to 2.3 as well.

@jakzal My pull for 2.3 was assuming this pull was not merged. If this can get merged into 5.3, then there is no issue, and I will close my pull.
