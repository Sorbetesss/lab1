In 3.2 we use file_exists, this somehow got lost in a merge I guess

you refactored in #20694 :) from the looks of it i'd say stream_resolve_include_path + include without @ but im not sure that needs to be supported or so; otherwise file_exists/is_file will do. Note 3.2 doesnt use @

let's do the same as in 3.2, that's fine
