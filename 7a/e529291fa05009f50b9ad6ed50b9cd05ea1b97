I suggest *also* adding my patch from https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/24127#issuecomment-367317851 (the second one), to use `profiler_dump(first)` when `first` represents a non-string value, instead of displaying the string-casting of the Data object (the class name with the number of property in it is totally useless).

We might even consider this as a bugfix.

Looks like a bug fix to me, no?

I have rebased my branch onto 3.4, and changed the base branch for this PR in order to merge it as a bug fix.
