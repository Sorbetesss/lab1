Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Appveyor test failures seem to be unrelated.

Whatâ€™s the problem with license headers reported by fabbot?

Can you please drop the code style commit? You can ignore fabbot's suggestions on these files as well as the license issues.
