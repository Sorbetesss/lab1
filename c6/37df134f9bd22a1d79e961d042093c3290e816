Tests are fine, maybe you missed a composer update before running them?

Ok my bad, travis is failing.
This is not the correct fix.
Instead, you should require-dev symfony/class-loader ~2.2 in the composer.json of the debug component

Exception message format has changed in #11034. #13173 added few more test cases in 2.5 and [tests started to fail](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/builds/45528192) after 2.5 was merged to 2.6.

I'll double check composer. I've been switching between branches quite a lot.

Hum, too fast again, let me check more carefully :)

Ok, your PR is good, :+1: sorry for the mistake
