I'm not even sure adding these constants adds much value

Hi @stof.
From my point of view the value I see in this change resides in allow to compare in a simple way (without taking care about specific request method names or case sensitivity)  the result of Request::getMethod() against the value of these constants, in the same way that passing method name as argument to Request::isMethod().
IE:
```php

switch ($request->getMethod()) {
    case Resquest::METHOD_POST:
        // do some stuff...
    break;
}
```
The main purpose is to allow this type of comparison outside this component, thus I understand that these internal modifications does not have much sense to you. I've updated the uses of method names here in order to keep coherence with this addition.

Adding the constant is ok-ish for me but using them internally is definitely not ok.

Ok, reverted internal uses of these class constants.
