Before I forget: Can I (or who can) add the FOSSHackathon label?

I guess tests are failing due to some other issue...?

@mpdude you should add the hashtags in the PR description (allowing to find all these issues and PR through the github search, even on multiple repos)

this requires either a doc PR or at least a doc issue.

Doc PR added.

@stof Not sure I understand how to do this

Regarding the failed tests, every test run fails due to different reasons. In all cases, I don't see how that would be related to this PR.

Rebased on master to give Travis/CI tests another try.
