I also fixed the cs problems reported by ubot.io. I'm not sure if I should be doing this in the same PR?

I must be still drunk after the conference too, as I thought I'm changing `$OK` into `$ok`...

@fabpot I like the idea behind `ubot.io`, is it proprietary software or I can use it for our repository too ?
p.s. sorry for offtop, but i don't know where to ask)

@tiger-seo I asked on twitter when he announced it, and he said that it will be available for other projects soon.
