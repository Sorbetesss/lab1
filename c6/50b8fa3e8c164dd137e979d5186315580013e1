Travis build fails on PHP5.3: https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/92963577#L2268
Result of the test suggests `substr` has been used instead of `mb_substr`. Is php5.3 on travis running with `--enable-mbstring` config option?

What should I do in that case?

If that's a bigger issue, I can propose a pull request to the `3.0` branch instead, which doesn't support php 5.3.

@mheki as a new feature, this should go to master (3.1)

P.S. don't worry about it though. Even though you submitted it to 2.8, it can still be merged to another branch by a merger.

I was trying to say you don't need a new one :)

Looks good to me but we need to check why the tests are falling.

Failures on 5.3 can be ignored: this PR will be merged on master, which require 5.5
