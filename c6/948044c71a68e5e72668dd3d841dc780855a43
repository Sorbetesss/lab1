I like this, small but useful! I noticed your screenshots mention "**an** public/private alias", but it's already fixed in your code (in case people notice this).

CI is failing due to some console width issue, can you update the tests to force a specific width? (there are other places doing so, can't recall right now)

Features are for master. The console width is forced there so rebasing and regenerating the fixture should make tests green.

Indeed, you are right, but I talked to @nicolas-grekas and we think it could be also merged as patch.
In this case we could get this from 2.8 upwards. WDYT?
But in this case we need to force the console width in this branch, too, right?

New features are for master only.

ok I will rebase my branch üëç

TBH I could not get the tests running, due to whitespaces, line endings or something else.
Tried vim and PHPStorm on a MacBook üò¢
