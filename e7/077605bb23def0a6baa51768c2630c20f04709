A minor comment to reviewers: missing the opening PHP tag may seem like a stupid problem ... but please trust us when we say that we have received lots of reports about this error. We really need to fix this issue one way or another. Thank you!

PR looks appropriate to me üëç , but yes it is a BC break

Besides of being a silly check forgotten, it's also quite embarrassing how you miss this error when helping someone. As more experienced phper, I kind of expect to see an open tag and if not present-make the basic assumption people simply left it out of the example. :+1: for this.

Personally I'd be OK to merge this into 2.7 btw. The potential BC break is not more allowed on master than on 2.7. Thus if we're ok to consider its potentiality is near to zero, then 2.7 should be the target.

@nicolas-grekas I don't agree. Introducing a potential BC break in master is ok and can be documented. Introducing a small BC break in a patch version is a no-go.
