Ping @nicolas-grekas : Can you take a look at that one?

The tests on ``components=high`` pass, but now, it's the ``components=low`` that has problems. The version installed is 2.4.5 (https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/45641726#L3033) where the ``Table`` that is needed does not existâ€¦ I updated the composer.json as i the console component must be at least at 2.5, what do you think about that?

@saro0h IMO, and when possible, we should remove usage of deprecated classes in the oldest possible branch.

I definitely can but I'll be obliged to do 2 PR (or more) because of the evolution of code between version.

Here is one exemple:
* 2.7: ``TextDescriptor::describeEventDispatcherListeners()`` exists and uses the TableHelper
* 2.5: The method does not exist at all.

Do you want me to do the work of removing the deprecated on all branches maintained on Symfony?

This is basically the same as #12970.

@xabbuh No it's not: the code changed between the two branches.

@saro0h Indeed, I missed that change. Thanks.
