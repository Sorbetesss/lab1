Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.3" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "5.4".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

@fancyweb if you have some availability and are keen on checking tat python code, you might want to work on porting the missing features to Symfony 6.3 :smile: I create a few issues about them (but I'm quite sure the list is still incomplete for now)
