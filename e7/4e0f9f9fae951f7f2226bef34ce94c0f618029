Hi, thanks. Could you add a test case please?

@nicolas-grekas you asked the one question that I hoped you wouldn't ask - anyway, I've added my first attempt at using phpunit ;)

Thanks ;) I made the mistake of just doing this change through github's editor - hence the multiple formatting commits. But equally 'easier' if you don't have everything checked out.

In terms of the failing travis/appveyor builds, i'd used changes to the test fixtures that went in with 4.2 - and applied the fix to 4.1 branch. I'll leave you guys to decide what if anything you want to do there ;)

`4.1` only receive security fixes, and this is not a security fix, so `4.2? should be right, as its a bug fix.
My question was, if you are sure that this "bug" is not present in `3.4`, in this case you must target `3.4`

`master` is only for new features

The issue was introduced in December 2017 by https://github.com/symfony/property-info/commit/e168420b9ca6bbadbd3d7fefe8f5683ca04efe56#diff-818203fea9c55d86a0556b0d436126df

That's been tagged as 4.1.0beta1 -> 4.2.3

Yes then `4.2` is the correct base branch

@mantis  Can you fix the tests and change the target to 4.2?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mantis at 2019-03-04T08:47:47Z

@fabpot - when i tried to change the target to 4.2, it started to want to pull in changes to the changelog,, and I got confused... IIRC, I think the test failures were only due to the target not being 4.2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you should rebase your feature branch against 4.2 and push `--force`, afterwards change the target base branch to 4.2 in the github UI

This should work

@mantis I can do it for you if you want.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@OskarStark @fabpot - I forced it - the tests were failing from adding in one of oskar's review comments. Current patch set passes as above, so I guess over to you guys ;)
