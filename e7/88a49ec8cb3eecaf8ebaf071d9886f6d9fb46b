ping @symfony/mergers : What do you think about this PR? IMHO this is really needed to be able to explore "dead" messages.

And what do you think about the new `MessageDecodingFailedStamp` class. IMHO, this is cleaner than before and more flexible.

Should I address comments and add some tests, or we gonna close it anyway?

Indeed, this could be very useful

before reviewing, do you still want this in core? can you please rebase + fix review comments if yes?

Yes it would be very useful!

I'll rebase it ASAP üëçüèº

@nicolas-grekas I addressed your comments, replay all examples, and updated the PR description. I think it's OK
