The phpdoc of `resolve` must be updated. It's outdated now. Also the BC break must be documented.

@Tobion you were probably talking about `resolveParameters` method, updated it. Added a note to description about BC break.

Please documented the BC break in the upgrade file in the root directory.

@nikita2206 Ass FrameworkBundle now relies on the `setCondition` to exists in the Router, you must upgrade the `symfony/routing` dependency in the `composer.json` file of the framework bundle (to 2.5 instead of 2.2).

@fabpot done (not sure why 2.5 though, PR is aimed at 2.7)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@nikita2206 That's because we test the compatibility of each component/bundle with different other versions (low and high).

Not sure why Travis did not trigger.
