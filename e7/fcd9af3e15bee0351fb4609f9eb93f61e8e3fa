Hey!

I think @rvanlaak has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

@welcoMattic Do you have time to answer Nicolas's question? Is it ready to be merged then?

Thank you for MR! I suggest to merge it to 5.4 but not to 6.1 because actually this can be considered as a fix for more obvious behavior. I've also been surprised when discovered the domains are got not from config.

@fabpot I fixed @nicolas-grekas comment, it's ready to merge now, sorry for the delay

@ossinkine we must consider it as a feature, because nothing is properly broken here

According to discussion with @nicolas-grekas, this PR is a bugfix. It's rebased on 5.4
