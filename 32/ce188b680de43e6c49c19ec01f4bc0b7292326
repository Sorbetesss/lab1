I like this idea a lot (and the PR explains it perfectly! thanks for that). Just as a very minor comment: given that we already use `GroupSequence` ... what if we use the same word ("sequence") for this too?

```
@Assert\Sequentially(...)  ->  @Assert\Sequence(...)
```

@javiereguiluz : I hesitated to explain this point in the PR, but I preferred to avoid naming it `Sequence` as in the original proposition, because I think it's too much connotated as "validating a number sequence" or an array with sequence as indexes. It's also easiest to understand it'll validate the nested constraint sequentially. But I'm fine with `Sequence` if it's only me :)
