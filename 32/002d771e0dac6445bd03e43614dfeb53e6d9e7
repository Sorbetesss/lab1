LGTM. Do we add a command for the CLI to purge the profiles? Or is `cache:clear` enough (which does not purge profiles if one use a non-based filesystem profile storage)? ... which leads to my next question: do we really need several storages for profiles? Looks like keeping only the filesystem one is more than enough. Thoughts?

My opinion:

  * Don't provide any command (`cache:clear` is enough)
  * Remove all storages except the filesystem one

@javiereguiluz Let's do it. Can you create a PR that deprecates all storages but the filesystem one? I think we can still keep the interface just in case.

Done in #15944.
