@Koc correct, back when I answered it, the sequences weren't that robust. Now that the `ArgumentResolver` creates the objects when not passed along, it's guaranteed that the default sequence will not cause this issue. Previously only with the `FrameworkBundle` this could be guaranteed.

So your comment was indeed correct, but ahead of time :+1:
