Instead of the current strategy, what about copy-pasting the existing Annotation classes code in the new Attribute classes, and then make existing Annotation classes extends those new Attribute classes.

@fancyweb I think that the current way of doing is better for upmerges. It will be easier for potential fixes if the annotation classes remain the same. Otherwise, all fixes in `Annotation*Loader` will have to be manually reflected in `Attribute*Loader` when merging to upper branches
