@WouterJ I agree! that's why I asked for help ... but sadly the issue stalled: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/16000

Btw, not sure where the error is coming from as SymfonyStyle implements OutputInterface and the isDebug method, but this is at least more correct than before.

Awesome. This fix works for me. No error so far.

Should I close the issue 16622 by myself?

@intermike good to hear that :) I've added your issue to the PR table in the description. When this PR is merged, the issue will be closed automatically.

Thanks for reporting this to Symfony!

@WouterJ : It only does in 3.0, not in 2.8 actually. Because it's only part of the `OutputInterface` since 3.0 for BC reasons, and the implementation in 2.8 was done in the `Output` class. Which is not extended by the `SymfonyStyle`  nor `OutputStyle`.
IMO it won't be a shame for the `OutputStyle` to provide those methods [as done in 3.0](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Style/OutputStyle.php#L117-L147).

:+1: to add them in 2.7. I consider it a bug that it isn't

It would be kind of ugly however, as it will require checking if each method exists in the provided `$output`, which could be any `OutputInterface` instance. Something like:

```php
# OutputStyle.php

public function isDebug()
{
    if (!method_exists($this->output, 'isDebug')) {
        throw new \BadMethodCallException(sprintf(
            'Method "%s" of "%s" does not exist',
            get_class($this->output),
            __METHOD__
        ));
    }

    return $this->output->isDebug();
}
```

Also we wouldn't be able to base ourself on this API for solving this issue depending on the output instance used in the commands :/

Status: Needs work

Changed it to set `$cliOutput` in the code instead of the parameter (proposal of @intermike). This way, the PR can be merged without deciding on the name of the Symfony style variable.

:+1:

The naming - and details in this PR - are all internal things anyways that can be changed later.
