@nicolas-grekas Should I submit this PR to the 2.8 branch?

As you want: we can also do the change while merging.

@nicolas-grekas I'm a bit confused and unclear on what the next steps. The tests was failed after changing the base branch from 4.1 to 2.8 and seems this is unrelated with this PR. Could you please elaborate on that?

You changed the branch on github after pushing, that's why. You can commit --amen and push force again to retrigger.
