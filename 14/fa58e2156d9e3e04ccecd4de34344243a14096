I'm wondering whether we should move the `unshift` into both public methods. That would avoid creating a copy of the array, but the copy might not be a big issue (it is unlikely to pass a huge array there)

Moving `array_unshift()` into the calling methods would at least improve the readability of `doLoad()` IMO. But that's not a blocker to me.
