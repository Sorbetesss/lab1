this is broken, because the min support version of the workflow component is still 3.4 currently.

There is 2 solutions here:

- bump the min version (and add a conflict rule ensuring that as it is an optional dependency)
- put a `method_exists` check to detect the presence of the new method

I would go for the first solution. Requiring people to upgrade to workflow 4.1+ when they upgrade FrameworkBundle to 4.1 is fine.

It's done. Tell me if my changes on composer.json are ok. Thanks.
