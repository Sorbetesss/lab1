Travis failure is unrelated

Can you add a test please?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Simperfit at 2018-02-12T08:24:06Z

@dunglas I will do, I'm searching a way to add one, I have to look on other command's tests to test the choices.

PR rebased.

Would be great, if it could be based on the 3.x-branch, too.

@althaus that's a new feature, it must go on 4.1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by althaus at 2018-03-06T09:40:52Z

@chalasr No plans for a 3.5? That's a pity for devs stuck on the 3.x branch for a while. ðŸ‘Ž

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by chalasr at 2018-03-06T09:44:51Z

@althaus Nope, 3.4 is the last 3.x version. That's the roadmap, nothing wrong, 4.0 is stable for a while.

I suggest to drop the existing `RouterDebugCommand` test, it is semi-functional (use a mocked kernel) and all of its tests are covered by the one added here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by althaus at 2018-03-08T08:38:11Z

@chalasr Oh... didn't know about the change in the release cycles and the limit of 5 minors.

So I'll just overload the command with my own version of this change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Simperfit at 2018-03-14T08:48:05Z

@chalasr @dunglas PR rebased, test fixed, semi-functional test deleted.
