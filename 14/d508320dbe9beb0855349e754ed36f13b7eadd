Hey!

I think @Th3Mouk has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

I don't know about the change, but this should target 5.4 or maybe 4.4 if the bug exists there also. Can you please confirm?

@nicolas-grekas yes this also applies to 5.4.x (I changed the PR to target 5.4 now) ... 4.4.x seems to be far off so running the test will result in totally different errors so i guess it's incompatible. Maybe someone with deeper knowledge/understanding of the component can check on 4.4?

@nicolas-grekas No one here to review? We also would love to see this fixed.
