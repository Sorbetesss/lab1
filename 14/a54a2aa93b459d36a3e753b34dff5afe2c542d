After some more investigations, it seems it doesn't happen on a fresh install. It happens on symfony-demo. The cause seems to be a conflict somewhere with bootstrap-sass, as removing it solves the issue.

@javiereguiluz : What do you think about merging this one? It's not ideal, because I didn't really identify the conflicting css rules leading to this strange behavior, but at least this patch has been proven effective for everyone in the referenced issue.

@ogizanagi you are right. Let's merge this. Thanks!
