Thank you @ndench
Is this ready for 4.4? Do your local tests work as expected?

Yep, seems to work as expected for me. I'm unsure why aappveyor is failing though.

The only issue I can see is if someone specifies `default-src: 'none' <some other source>` at which point we won't remove the `'none'`. However, that means their CSP was invalid before the WebProfiler touches it, so I don't think that's a problem.
