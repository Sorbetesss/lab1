The feature looks strange to me: a StringUtil in the Form component to deal with non-form-related situations. If I'm the only one, then an entry in the CHANGELOG is missing :)

@nicolas-grekas
Although I said this feature is used without creating a form, this substantially concerns the form ([as document explains](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/form/introduction.html), it focuses on processing data) I think.
It's just like the `StringUtils` in `Security/Core`.

btw, I have just updated CHANGELOG :)

Oh..., I marked deprecation "yes" mistakenly. There is no deprecation in this PR.

Thanks @issei-m! Could you rebase this onto 2.8 and fix the issues I mentioned? After that, I'm :+1:.
