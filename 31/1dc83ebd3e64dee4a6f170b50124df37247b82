The issue was talking about problems happening in Apache, so I doubt that disabling it only on CLI will fix it.

It was about apache calling commands in a subprocess, isn't it?

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/41130#issuecomment-948603479 should be checked, as it talks about nested caching in parallell requests

Calling `LockRegistry::setFiles([])` will work for these cases.
