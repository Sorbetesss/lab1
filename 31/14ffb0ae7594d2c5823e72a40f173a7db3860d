Oh... Tests failed in 4.0 branch :worried:

That's for branch 3.4 I suppose, the bug is there also, isn't it?

@chalasr you've renamed PR. Should I change commit description?

@upyx you can, but not a requirement (the rest of the message is precise enough to not care). The reasoning behind the title change is that this change impacts FrameworkBundle only, and we use the title PR as merge commit message.

I've rebased commit on head of 3.4. Tests was broken by merging 2.8 into 3.4.
