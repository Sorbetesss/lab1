There's technically a minor BC break: a service whose parent is autowired, would not have been autowired before, but now it would be. But, except for an *optional* dependency in the constructor, instantiation of that child would have failed, because it would be missing its autowired dependencies. So, the BC break is for child services that have optional, type-hinted constructor args: the container will now try to autowire those, but it didn't before.

Still, this is a bug and that's seems like a *real* edge-case. I think we should fix it.

If I'm right, should be update the CHANGELOG or UPGRADE doc?

Although i wouldn't treat it as a BC break. Technically it should either be a bugfix or a BC break :)

@jakzal Let me know if I can do something for that.
For now this is described as a bugfix but referenced as a BC break in the DI's changelog.
