Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.4 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Thank you very much for the review and the feedback @weaverryan :pray: . I've made changes according to your suggestions, let me know if you see anything else I could do.

@maelanleborgne #51650 is merged, so you can rebase your commits to remove them from this PR. Probably THAT PR was also rebased, so this can get a little tricky - I've been doing it a lot lately ðŸ˜†

One more relevant PR just got merged- can you rebase? Let me know if you have any questions - hopefully thatâ€™ll simplify things, as remote packages ALWAYS have a version now.

Is this still WIP?

Yes I still have some work to do now that #51786 has been merged.
