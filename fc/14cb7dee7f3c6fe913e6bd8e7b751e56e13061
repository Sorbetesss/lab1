The renaming looks like a good idea to me üëç

Branch rebased, PR is ready for review.

1st commit about renaming classes in bridges
2nd about some cleanup of built transports: abstract http and api classes moved under transport, in same time transport implementations moved under corresponsing sub-namespaces. So now `Transport` sub-namespace [contains only abstractions + Dsn](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/b9dd600ffd4a347148b57af359fdc2df7cdf576d/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Transport)

Having shorter namespaces is also a goal. I would revert the creation of the `Chain`, `Null`, and `Sendmail` namespaces.

But in this case we got mess inside `Transport` subnamespace: a lot of classes, abstractions mixed with implementations.

There are 2 PRs with new transports (file, in-memory) that contribute to same `Transport` Subnamespace.

But File and InMemory transports do not exist (and will probably never exist).

There are pending PRs about that: #31947, #32409

Haven't had time to have a look at them yet, but I don't think they will be merged.

Creation of the `Chain`, `Null`, and `Sendmail` namespaces has been reverted.
