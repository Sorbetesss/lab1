I think the right type declaration according to phpstan would be something like this `ArrayIterator<int, FormView>`. Jetbrains IDE is also working on parsing this declaration.

Does this declaration work for you? e.g. does not trigger a phpstan warning?

@CoalaJoe it does not trigger PHPStan warnings

During the discussion in https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataAdminBundle/pull/6258#issuecomment-670849147

We concluded, that `\ArrayIterator<string, FormView>` is the right type
