Can you please have a look at failing tests?
Please also update the table in the description of your PR, we need them to be filled in to triage things.
Thanks.

@CoalaJoe No worries about tests (as the failed one is not related to this PR). Could you add a test about this new feature?

I am sorry. I do not know where to start nor what to do. Can someone give me a hand?
