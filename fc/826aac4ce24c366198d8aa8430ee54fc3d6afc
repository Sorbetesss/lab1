I've just added support for annotations too :). Doc is coming.

Why is it useful to expose `compiler_class`?

Well, I was not sure, I did it by consistency. I felt like it was hidden and deserved to shine too :), but no hard feeling, if there is no real use case for it let's just keep utf8 which should increase DX (see related doc PR).

I would remove it, that's an internal settings that does not need to be exposed.

Done, I exposed the defaults instead, WDYT?

Status: needs review

@HeahDude Can you have a look at the broken tests?
