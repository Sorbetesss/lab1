This PR is ready for review/vote. I updated the patch to have almost no behavioral change but only semantic added-value.
Instead of replacing an argument, I just added a new one :)

That the console now correctly displays fatal errors is cool. But this will only be working when using the framework bundle. Can this not be handled within the component?

Having this in the framework bundle allows configuration flexibility.
But then doesn't prevent adding fatal error handling right into the console component later in an other PR.
