Fabbot error is a false positive (it doesn't support PHP 7.1 yet).

üëç but I propose to wait and see what happens to this feature before the release of 7.1 to merge the PR.

If we want people to test Symfony with PHP 7.1, we should provide the compatibility. It's already in RC now, so things shouldn't change as much.
