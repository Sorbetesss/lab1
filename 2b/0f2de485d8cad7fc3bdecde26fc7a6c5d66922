I just tried running this and it returned `null`, with no "undefined" notice:
```php
$r = new Request();

var_dump($r->getClientIp());
```

I think the docblock contains a type that must be, but not one that can be.
There is a lot of not null fields in Request class which will be null after `new Request()`.

No, docblock must specify type it returns

But now it is not so, we must be consistent. If we want the docblock to contain what the method returns, we need to add `|null` to other fields and check that the field is not null when we call the getter, but we donâ€™t do that, it is a huge number of redundant checks.
