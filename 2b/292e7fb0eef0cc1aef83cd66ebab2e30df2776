@ogizanagi where does this happen to you? On macOS + Chrome or Firefox I see the close button with the right color without having to do this change:

And the color is maintained when hovering the mouse pointer:

@javiereguiluz : It happens to me and a teammate, with Symfony 6.2.0 using on macOS + Chrome 108.0.5359.71, Firefox and Safari as well ðŸ¤”

It's strange that I don't see this issue when using the same browser + OS.

In any case, your contribution is perfect and it doesn't hurt at all to define the color explicitly. So, let's merge this. Thanks!

To complete, here is what shows the Chrome inspector on the `<svg>` element:

Thanks for sharing this. Now I know what happened ... the `app.css` file of my apps apply a `color: inherit` to certain form elements. That's the difference with your app and that's why I couldn't see this issue while working on the redesign ðŸ™ˆ
