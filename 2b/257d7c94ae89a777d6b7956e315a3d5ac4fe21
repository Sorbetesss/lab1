There are many more occurrences right? Or is it work in progress :)

Already many people switch their infrastructure to HHVM this PR will complicate working with symfony for them.

Are the really people switching from PHP 7 to HHVM (or from PHP 5 to HHVM instead of PHP 7)?

@flip111 I'm sorry but the evidence we have (including Composer's own stats abut PHP usage) shows that almost nobody is using HHVM.

People were switching to HHVM before PHP 7 was a thing. Since removing functionality (support for an alternative platform) is a big thing i had at least expected to see something positive here on the tradeoff.

@flip111 see also #22765. The thing is, since things do not happen by magic, HHVM support needs someone to care about it. Here, nobody cared nor made it to work on a PHP 7.1 code base. Unless *you* want to do the job, it looks like nobody did in the last months, if not years.

@nicolas-grekas fair enough, would have been nice to have in the PR description something like `"hhvm support was not properly maintained for months, removing to reduce the burdon of maintaining this code. [User statistics](link) show that hhvm was hardly used."`. This is not obvious to know before i asked about it.

So, if HHVM support is being removed from `master`, that means it'll stay around for Symfony 3.4 LTS which is going to be maintained until November 2020, am I right? So, I'd say HHVM/Symfony projects are safe for another 3.5 years.

Within those 3.5 years, those projects could be migrated away from HHVM (or Symfony if you like) or HHVM maybe manages to get their compatibility issues under control.

And Symfony is going to be your least problem. Other libraries that go php-7-only will be running into similar trouble and most of the have shorter maintenance periods than Symfony does.

Anyway, maybe the drop of HHVM should be announced in a blog article with some explanation to avoid confusion.

I agree with the fact we should write a blog post about this /cc @javiereguiluz
