> min or max option indicate that the Range

since this is using some heuristic logic, I would suggest reporting this when min AND max are can be parsed as dates.

@nicolas-grekas I've modified the PR. As I understand, if one of the boundries is null and the other one is parsable DateTime string, this should also return `invalidDateTimeMessage` instead of `invalidMessage`?

@przemyslaw-bogusz I think you're right for your latest question. Still willing to finish this PR for master?
