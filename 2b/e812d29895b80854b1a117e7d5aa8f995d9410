Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "5.4".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Instead of using `proc_open` directly, we could also use `Process`, which would likely solve the issue. wdyt?
