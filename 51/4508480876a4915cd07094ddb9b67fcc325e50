I think the intention was to have something like `This form should not contain extra fields: "notes1", "notes2", "notes3"`

Congrats on your first Symfony pull request! :tada:

For the merger team: an alternative could be add the extra quotes before and after the imploded fields, but I agree with the style proposed (it's unlikely that form field names will contain commas, and the extra quotes get escaped in APIs using JSON format making it look ugly).

@fabpot Unfortunately it isn't doing so... I feel we should take the code one way or the other - would with quotes or without quotes be better? Without the first and last quote feels weird...

I would add the missing quotes instead of removing them to be consistent with the way we display other error messages.

added missing quotes as per suggestion from @fabpot
