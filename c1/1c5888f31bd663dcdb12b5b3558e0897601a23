Well, to fix the issue fully, it is not the only place which should be changed

I've found another reference to the magic "_root" node (in parents()), which I've removed.

@stof Is that what you mean? If not, could you please give me a hint of the other place(s) you're referring to? Thanks!

@robbertkl there are also such cases in the handling of forms in ``Form::initialize``

@stof Thanks, I see what you mean now.

I've added changes in `Form::initialize()` and in `Field\FormField::__construct()` as well. Tests still pass.

@robbertkl could you rebase your work ? It conflicts with the merge of #10205

Done!
