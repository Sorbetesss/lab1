Won't the version be `null` when you omitted the `version` attribute in the XML format (instead of setting it to an empty string)?

There is a case, if version is omitted - then default strategy used.

If we change it and if in xml omitted version considered as empty strategy (also as we need sync same logic for php, yml then) - we will have broken BC.

There is also legacy code (framework templating configuration) that have different logic - omitted considered as empty.

There is no possible to set attribute in xml to null as far as I know :(

:+1:

@ewgRa Can you rebase to get rid of the 2 merge commit that prevents me from merging? Or even better, squash all commits. Thanks.
