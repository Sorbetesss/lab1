CS should be fixed. But more important, what's the point?

@fabpot : the point is being dry. I wrongly opened #21747 to fix a bug that had already been fixed, and was told that while I was at it, I should refactor this piece of code that is pretty repetitive. With this change, adding new units like `G` or `Gi` should be way easier / less error prone. Once I noticed I was using outdated code, I closed the PR, and was told (on slack) that I should make a PR to not throw away these changes that were deemed good although they do not fix any bug.

Note how there is less code after the change, the diffstat says "+10 âˆ’15"
