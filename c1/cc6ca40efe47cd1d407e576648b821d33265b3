I don't understand why quiet and interactive would be tied. I made this decoupling consciously back then. It looks more flexible. So, I'm ðŸ‘Ž for this change.

I understand your concern about the responsibilities, but the fact I'm exposing here is that isn't possible to interact with a command when it is executed in quiet mode, given the command isn't able to prompt for any input or provide any kind of response to the user. For this reason, I think a method called `isInteractive()` must return `false` when the command isn't allowed to interact with the user at all.

Ah, understood now. Indeed, if even the questions are not displayed, that does not really make sense to have an interactive quiet command :)
