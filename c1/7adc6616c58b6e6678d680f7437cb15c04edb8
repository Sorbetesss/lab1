The workflow component does not exist in the 2.7 branch. So do we really want to merge it in 2.7?

I suggested @lyrixx to submit on 2.7 so that we don't have to deal with any merge conflicts on this file. Sensible?

@csarrazi can we add you to Ldap?
@jderusse to Lock?

If we were to do that, I suggest that we do it for everybody in this PR.

I'm not sure everyone deal with notifications in the same way. I prefer to let people decide.

@nicolas-grekas isn't there a requirement to be able to have write access to the repository for that feature?

In any case, sure, but as mentioned numerous times, I can not provide any sort of SLA on response time for tickets or notifications. In the medium term, if someone feels comfortable with this, I would be glad if anyone wished to take over the LDAP component.
