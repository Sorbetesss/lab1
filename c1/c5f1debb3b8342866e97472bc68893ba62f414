Cool, thank you! Do you have any suggestions to make it better?

@nicolas-grekas maybe yes. I have tested the result cast and afaicr I couldn't tell the index of the last fetched result. Postgres' cursors are scrollable, you can iterate several times on them and fetch directly the nth row of a result. I could not see that in the stub (maybe this data is not available but I think it is).

I found pg_result_seek() for seeking, but nothing for getting the current cursor position. Can you find a way to get it?

Don't mind, there are no PHP functions for that, this is why it is kept in Pomm's iterators.

All good !
