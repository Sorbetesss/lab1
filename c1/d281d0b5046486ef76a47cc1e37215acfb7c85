This seems like a bugfix to me :thinking:

@MatTheCat I understand your point of view and went for a bugfix as well at first sight. Fundamentally, the `no_limit` policy works well without this PR. Here, we actually "just" improve the developer experience. I think this is why it is more considered as a feature, rather than a bugfix.
