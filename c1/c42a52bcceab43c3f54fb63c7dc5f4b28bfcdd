The label "BC break" should be removed. With some tests it would be üëç , thanks!

@HeahDude Yes, the label has been added by mistake, I made an error with the PR template... And I can't seem to be able to remove it ;).

Here are the tests, I had to add an Interface so the use case would be adequately represented. I double checked, the tests fail without the patch. I think I'm good for the full review.

The failed tests on appveyor and travis concern the Twig Bridge and Bundle or the SecurityBundle. It's unrelated to this PR.

Status: Needs Review

@HeahDude I updated the tests to take into account your comments. Thanks for the feedback. The interfaces are now named `EntityInterfaceA` and `EntityInterfaceB`. I think that's the cleanest way to go for Test Fixtures...

LGTM üëç, thanks!

Failures unrelated and should now be fixed by #20079.
