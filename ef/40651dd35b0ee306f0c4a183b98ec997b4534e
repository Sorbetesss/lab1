What about using this great feature in Form, the component that needs it most? They even define [a method called renderBlock()](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Form/FormRenderer.php#L95)

@javiereguiluz Unfortunately the logic in the Form integration is complex and cannot use this technique as we are manually passing blocks to `renderBlock()`.

Updated based on the latest changes for Twig 1.28.
