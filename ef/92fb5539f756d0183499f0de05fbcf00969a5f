Hey!

I think @keichinger has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Good catch, however adding `identical comparison` on 4.4 can be a BC break (method has only phpdoc and is not type hinted).

This change cannot be done before 6.0 if it's considered as bugfix

Thanks @alamirault for the fast feedback!

In this case, should I close this PR and open a new one for `6.0` version or can I switch the base branch in this PR?

You can switch target branch however i'm not sure if it must be on 6.0 ou 6.2

@alamirault I have updated the base branch to `6.2` and switched the answer for `Bug fix?` to `yes`. Hopefully, that is enough :)
