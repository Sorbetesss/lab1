@ro0NL sorry, I didn't pay attention to that. It's fixed now, thank you :)

looking at no. of changed tests, perhaps it was better to add one new test (if reasonably possible). Im not sure this will cause to many merge conflicts with lower branches. Let's see :)

@ro0NL tests updated. Created a new test instead of modifying existing ones.
