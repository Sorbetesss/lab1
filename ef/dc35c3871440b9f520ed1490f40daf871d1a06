I've implemented the change proposed by @stloyd based on the idea of @dunglas, rebased on master and fixed some tests.
There's still some that fail but I'm not used to symfony internals and I don't immediately see the changes I should make. If someone more knowledgeable can help, I would be thankful.

@nrobinaubertin Can you take @ogizanagi suggestion into account and fix the unit tests? Thank you.

Done. I added two tests but the previous ones were already working.
The fails of the CI are not related to this PR
