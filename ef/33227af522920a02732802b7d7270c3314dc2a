Hey!

I think @jack-worman has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Didn't think of this case @GromNaN, thank you! I'm taking a look at it soon.

That seems to be a special feature made by @nicolas-grekas. The value is correctly resolved by the command from a config pov.

There is a conflict in the changelog, can you rebase please?

Very interesting, thank you for the investigation Jérôme!

Also, the rebase is done :slightly_smiling_face:
