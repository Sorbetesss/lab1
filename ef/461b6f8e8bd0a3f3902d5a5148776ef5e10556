Could you please merge this PR #39454 with #39455?

Just for my curiosity, why? ☺️

when the PRs contain the same thing, it's easier to review:
- when something has changed, it's easier to check if it has been applied in all components
- can review everything once (no need to open PR individually one by one)

Done @jderusse 👍
