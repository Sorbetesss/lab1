I want to ask you about naming.

We have a `TranslationWriter` which uses `DumperInterface`.
We also have a `TranslationLoader` which uses `LoaderInterface`.

Should this interface be called `TranslationReaderInterface` instead? Then we got a reader/writer.

👍  Reader/Writer naming looks natural. It's also used by the best programming languages:

* Java: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/package-summary.html
* C#: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream(v=vs.110).aspx
* Go: https://golang.org/pkg/io/

I've renamed the interface now. I'm happy if I could get a review to this PR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you @chalasr. I made this PR simpler by just adding the interface. When/If merged, I will update #23666

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Nyholm at 2017-08-02T14:18:20Z

Is it anything else I can do to get this PR merged?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it would be nice to have the implementation of `TranslationReaderInterface` in this PR. Merging a PR with an interface that is not even used internally looks weird to me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Nyholm at 2017-08-02T17:10:20Z

I made 4 different PRs to keep things separate. I think I made a headache for myself. I will add an implementation here and close https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/23666

@Nyholm Can you rebase to get rid of the merge commit?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by chalasr at 2017-08-03T09:27:42Z

@Nyholm this line needs to be updated https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Tests/DependencyInjection/FrameworkExtensionTest.php#L980 for instantiating the `TranslatorPass` with the same args as `FrameworkBundle` does. Once fixed we should be OK regarding BC layers  :)

Thank you. I've updated the PR

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for the review. Ive updated accordingly.

PR is rebased and test are green.

ping @symfony/deciders

Should I rebase this one more time?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2017-08-22T13:01:40Z

yes please (and squash meanwhile if you want)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2017-08-22T13:07:04Z

Are we sure we want to move away from `Loader`s and introduce `Reader`s? Loaders are what we are using everywhere else in the framework. Dumpers are also everywhere, except here as we have `Writer`s. Not sure what is best? Be more consistent with other languages or more consistent with Symfony?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Are we sure we want to move away from Loaders and introduce Readers?

Yes. We do not give up the concept of "Loader" we just rename it for clarity.

### Before

* We have a `TranslationWriter` (implements `TranslationWriterInterface`) which uses `DumperInterface`.
* We also have a `TranslationLoader` which uses `LoaderInterface`.

### After

* We have a `TranslationWriter` (implements `TranslationWriterInterface`) which uses `DumperInterface`.
* We also have a `TranslationReader` (implements `TranslationReaderInterface`)  which uses `LoaderInterface`.

If we do not rename it to *Reader then we would have a `TranslationLoaderInterface` and `LoaderInterface` which is confusing.

------------

I'll rebase and squash shortly.

@Nyholm very clear. Confusion was on my end. Looks good to me.

@Nyholm can you rebase please?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course.
