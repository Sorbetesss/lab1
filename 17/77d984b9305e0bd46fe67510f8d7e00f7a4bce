The implementation looks good to me. Can you add some unit tests as well?

Also, you need to add a note in the component CAHNGELOG file and submit a PR on the documentation to document this new feature. Thanks.

@fabpot I am working on the tests and documentation right now.  For the change log, I did not see a `CHANGELOG-2.3.md` file in the root of the project -- where would you like me to document this change?

I created [pull request #2442 against the symfony-docs repo](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/2442) to update the symfony book.  Still working on the tests!

I've added the tests and submitted the documentation PR, let me know if either of these are not up to snuff!

@stof I've fixed the issues you pointed out, thanks!  I also rebased against master.

@danfinnie you should add it in the changelog of the bundle
