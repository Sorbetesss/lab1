Because processing configuration is done internally in `Extension::load()`, we have no proper way to get the processed configuration from the outside.

I didn't find any better implementation than the one in this PR, which consist of storing processed configs when `Extension::processConfiguration()` is being called, then fetching these with a new `Extension::getProcessedConfigs()` method.

This works only if extensions do call `processConfiguration()` of course.
I'd expect this to be a common enough situation to consider the issue fixed.
If the expectation is not met, the outcome is that overridden env vars are tracked again, which is not a huge issue anyway, and is just the current situation.

Decoupling config processing from loading is another possibility, but that'd be asking for big changes for all bundle authors. Not worth it IMHO.

PR is ready (failures are false positives.)
