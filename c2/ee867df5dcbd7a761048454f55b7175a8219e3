I'm not sure how to suppress the deprecations. I've added `@group legacy` to the test classes but I guess the deprecations are triggered earlier?

The component is [still downloaded 30K/day](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/templating/stats). Not on legacy projects since there is 6.4K daily installs for the v6.

I think a good chunk of the downloads are transient. For instance, [knplabs/knp-time-bundle](https://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/knp-time-bundle) requires it and has ~4k daily downloads.

:+1: for the proposal. Deprecating it will still mean maintaining it for the duration of the LTS, so 3 more years.

Any corresponding config tree in frameworkbundle that should also be deprecated?

Didn't this happen in #32267 already?
