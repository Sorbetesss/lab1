This case was omitted when adding deserialization support for complex relations (in 3.1). IMO it should be merged in 3.1.

Can you add a test for this?

Hm, looks like this also occurs for setters but this is a bigger problem: the serializer leave the set part to the property accessor, so it doesn't have access to the mutator and can't guess the type.

@dunglas not sure where the problem lies right now, will have to dig a bit into it later although I hope there won't be any big change.
