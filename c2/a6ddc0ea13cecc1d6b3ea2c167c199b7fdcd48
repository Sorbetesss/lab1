@xabbuh The listener is private now

The event-dispatcher does not allow private listeners before 3.3... Can we let it public, or shall I update the framework's event-dispatcher requirement to `~3.3`?
Edit: Reverted to public, it's not worth it IMHO.

Why not updating the version and make use of the new features?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@xabbuh To be honest, I'm often asking myself when is it better to update the requirement and I'm never sure. Isn't it too bad to forbid using the FrameworkBundle with older versions than 3.3 just to avoid one more built-in listener being public? When do we consider that it's legit to increase the required version of a component?

Anyway I made the change, thanks

Edit: Got it. It is acceptable to have a conflict for a component in a bundle (here framework), but should be avoided as possible for component-to-component dependencies.

@chalasr I think most people upgrade all Symfony components from one version to the next, especially as many just use symfony/symfony, which does not provide any flexibility. Having broader constraints help with compatibility with other libs using Symfony though.

Makes sense, thank you for the hint @fabpot

Build failure is unrelated.
