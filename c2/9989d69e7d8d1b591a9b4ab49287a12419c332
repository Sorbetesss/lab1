We don't handle dumping null names, that's what you mean? Any suggestions?
Worth a test case?
Shouldn't this be merged in 4.4?

We don't handle a `PrototypedArrayNode` that has no key attribute and that have another `PrototypedArrayNode` as its child.

I don't think so. A test should be added once we support it.

No because the `string` arg type on `setName()` was added in 5.0.
