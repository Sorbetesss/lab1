Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.1" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "7.1 for bug fixes".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Maybe we should backport #57694. In tests we don't use version 4 of web-token/jwt-library, but since we don't have a conflict rule for it consumers of symfony/security-http can use it and run into the issue this PR is going to fix.

Better back port than conflict to me also.
