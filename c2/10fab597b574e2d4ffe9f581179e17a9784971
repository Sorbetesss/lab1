Shouldn't the dot be escaped in the property path instead?

For the minimal reproducer, yes, but it doesn't help with the original issue where the author uses Serializer and doesn't have the hand on the underlying property paths.

Inevitably, this is closely linked to stdClass, hence the hard check in the code to make sure you're dealing with stdClass.

Can this not be fixed inside the Serializer component?

Actually, escaping the dot seems only to work with array accesses. The following code breaks:

```php
$stdclass = (object) ['bankAccount.iban' => 'NL16TEST0436169118', 'bankSummary' => ''];
$accessor = PropertyAccess::createPropertyAccessor();

dump($accessor->getValue($stdclass, 'bankAccount\.iban')); // throws NoSuchPropertyException
```

Or maybe I'm using the wrong syntax?
