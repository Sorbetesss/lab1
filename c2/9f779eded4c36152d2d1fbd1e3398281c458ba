Maybe I'm wrong here - can one rely on the first argument being the command?

If so, \Symfony\Component\Console\Tester\CommandTester::execute does not seem to guarantee this.

I think this is going to be fixed by https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/14197 already

Not sure if #14197 does the right thing (tm)?

@mpdude FYI $input->getArgument('command') return the cmd name and doesn't allow to know if the user uses the alias or name to execute this command

So, trying to fix it by making sure the `CommandTester` adds the command name as first argument.

If the first argument has such a special meaning and can (always?) be expected to contain the (unparsed?) command name, maybe that would be worth a doc note somewhere? (DocBlock?)

Please merge so folks with open PRs can rebase and get their tests green again :-)

Can anyone see why some of the Travis builds still fail as before?
