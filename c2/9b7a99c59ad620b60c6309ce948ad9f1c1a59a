To avoid any redraw and ensure maximum performances, we should implement the reordering directly in CSS

```css
#menu-profiler {
  /** ... existing rules */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
#menu-profiler li:has(span.disabled) {
    order: 1;
}
```

(`:has` is [baseline in 2023](https://caniuse.com/css-has) so this work for more than 95% of users, and the few ones with browsers not implementing `:has` will just see the list as before)

Simon, you are a genius üôá üôá I did what you suggested: it works perfectly and it solves the remaining performance issues. The profiler pages now feel very snappy. Thanks!

This is now ready for a final review.
