How important is it to have _collision-free_ tokens? I mean, the places where we've cut six characters out of a hash were certainly not collision-free, but `TraceableSerializer` used the (allegedly) collision-free `uniqid()` directly.

We could increase the length of the generated string. What do you think about that?
