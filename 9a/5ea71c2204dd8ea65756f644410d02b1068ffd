@dunglas should I change something [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Serializer/Encoder/XmlEncoder.php#L472-L475) too ?

It should be tested but it looks like a good idea.

@dunglas I already added a test [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17984/files#diff-0590165d9e66621f7d21653e42d21f65R207).

And I didn't completely understand what does ``selectNodeType`` so I can't tell if this patch has to be added in it and what would it change.
