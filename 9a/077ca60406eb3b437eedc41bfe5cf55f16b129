oops. I did not notice it was added to 3.4 milestone. I thought it should be based on 3.4 branch and resubmit it.

@palex-fpt no need for a new PR, we can switch the target branch while merging, but you can also do it on your side https://blog.github.com/2016-08-15-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request/ (and rebase).
