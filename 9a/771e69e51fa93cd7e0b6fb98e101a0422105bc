to further clarify; im spotting `array|\Traversable` API in master; probably to be intended as `iterable` type. Which we do favor.. no? :)

`iterable` didn't exist when we added `array|\Traversable`
but we're not (I'm not at least)  going to change all of them for the fun of it...

Could be merged in 3.4, but not in 2.7 anyway.

Hm, why not? Safe change to me. Without involving php71 feats, this is indeed about changing the implementation from iterators to iterables; enabling removal of ArrayObject inits.

Done on 2.7 to avoid merge conflicts and not have `toIterator(): iterable` behavior :angel:

That's not a bug fix, so it does not qualify for 2.7. We've been doing too many such changes in lower branches in the recent history. But that was a mistake.
