is there any way to have a test covering this to prevent regressions ?

I won't be able to add a test covering that because it requires an HTTPS endpoint. Of course we could add some network services, but that's going to be too time consuming to setup properly...

Of course, I would gladly accept a PR that adds the test if anyone reading is up to give it a try!
