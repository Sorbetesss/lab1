/cc @morozov @derrabus @greg0ire does [that](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/50742/files#diff-2a38c9deb498eec50126c297bb3d094c8efb29364934e902d6481761ace6f20a) sound correct to you?

IIRC, the alternative to `toSaveSql` is to introspect only the schema assets that you actually manage before comparing it to the target schema. The rationale is that if you introspect a database with lots of tables/columns/indexes/etc although you're interested in one table only, you keep the database unnecessarily busy.

Can you help with this? I'm not fluent enough in Doctrine to turn that into code :see_no_evil:
Or is the attached patch good enough?
