Supporting Heredoc is a bit more complex, because you can have string interpolation in it (and your eval call would probably be totally broken in such case).

And if you support Heredoc, you should also support [Nowdoc](http://fr2.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc) (which should be simpler as there is no interpolation in it)

The alternative to `eval` would be to do something like https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/blob/master/lib/PHPParser/Node/Scalar/String.php

However I can find quite a few places in symfony where `eval` is being used. Is this a hard requirement, or just a suggestion?

@stof the php extractor does not do any type of interpolation - that's pretty much impossible. It just tokenizes PHP and extracts strings.

So this should probably already work with Nowdoc. I'll add a testcase

The code I've used here is BSD-3 clause. Is this compatible with MIT ?

@fabpot I've added the license headers. Is that what you had in mind ?
