I've worked with @userdude on this issue, so I won't change the status, but I too have experienced this bug and I can attest that this solution fixes it.

This fix needs to go into the 3.3 branch. 3.2 is EOL.

Rebased to 3.4, will try to add the 2.8 regression test as a separate PR but will be next week.
