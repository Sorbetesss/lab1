But initial_places was also a thing and should not be removed from the README, shouldnâ€™t it?

Even this line was not introduced in your referenced PR #30890 ðŸ¤”

Or do you mean to skip 2 iterations which were both introduced in 4.3 go straight to initial_marking?

In the last release from 4.2 branch (v4.2.12), the configuration node is called "initial_place":
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7b0ca3ab5678232f876a95991b66778f4aaa33e3/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/DependencyInjection/Configuration.php#L230
In the first release from 4.3 branch (v4.3.0), the configuration node is called "initial_marking":
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/0bf8d128ef3c492436ab5f1b7c7b130f9e96aad2/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/DependencyInjection/Configuration.php#L236

So, answering your question, I think yes:
>Or do you mean to skip 2 iterations which were both introduced in 4.3 go straight to initial_marking?
