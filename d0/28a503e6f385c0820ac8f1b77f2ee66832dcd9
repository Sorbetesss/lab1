Thanks for the taking over!
Features are for the master branch :) Rebase needed

Oh ok, I was targeting the same version as the previous PR but I guess 5.0 was release since ^^

Oh I rebased before switching the targeted branch for this PR, so the CI failed

I have restarted from Simperfit branch, rebase it on top of master and then cherry pick my commit. I think it should be good now :)

I think @dunglas, @jderusse, @lyrixx, @sroze and @xabbuh were automatically added as reviewer when I strangely rebase between branch 4.4 and master. The PR contained their commit by mistake. But I cannot remove them from the reviewers... I'm sorry for the flood :disappointed:
