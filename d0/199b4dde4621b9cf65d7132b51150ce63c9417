I've also added a test but i'm not sure it is worth the effort

If we're sure that it's safe to call `LISTEN` multiple times (I didn't find any information about that in the manual), then +1 on my side!

@goetas Can you have a look at the tests, https://github.com/symfony/symfony/runs/7711529784?check_suite_focus=true might be related to this change.

I have fixed the test, it was because i had locally dbal 3.x instlled while on CI 2.x is runing. https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/47209/files#r939714144 does a different mocking by trying to detect which dbal is running
