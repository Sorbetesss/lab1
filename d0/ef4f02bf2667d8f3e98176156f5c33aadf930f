Can you please update the screenshots to also include a `ChoiceType` with `expanded` set to `true`? Reason is that in this case the `ChoiceType` is also compound and I wonder if the layout would still look right then.

It looks like something for 6.3 instead.

@xabbuh Thanks for your advice! You are right, there was a problem with my earlier code. I fixed it and re-pushed and also attached the complete usage code and screenshots to the description. Now I'm working on fixing some tests.

I've fixed some tests for this PR. `continuous-integration/appveyor/pr` was originally failed on the base 6.3 branch and is not fixed in this PRðŸ¤”
