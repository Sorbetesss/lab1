@derrabus What about the solution of @nicolas-grekas? It sounds simpler to me :)

I'm for this alternative :+1:, this class looks really `@internal`.

I agree. In that case, we wouldn't need a deprecation layer at all, I guess.

@lyrixx caution, it seems that you pushed a commit under my name :)

I updated the PR to mark the class `Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\EventListener\DebugHandlersListener` as internal

Should I put something in `UPGRADE-6.0.md` ?

Hello,

What is missing for this PR?

Note: I keep rebasing this PR because of a conflit on `UPGRADE-5.3.md`

Maybe add a changelog entry in the component?

I added a note in the CHANGELOG of HttpKernel Component
