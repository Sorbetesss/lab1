Isn't this considered a BC break?

@WouterJ If you override `Application::renderException()` you should specify `$e` and `$output` without type hint.
This PR fix the type hint and you will update your `renderException` method to add the type hint.

For me it's a BC break.

The [BC promise](http://symfony.com/bc) says:

 > Add type hint to an argument: NO (in case of an API method)

As this is an API method, it can't be done in the 2.x releases. That means this PR should be merged into Symfony 3.0 (the master branch). You don't have to open a PR, as the mergers have tools that can switch the branches quite easily when merging.

Btw, I'm +1 for adding the type hints :)

+1 to merge this in 3.0 too. Accordingly, the content of the `UPGRADE` file must be moved in 3.0.

@fabpot It's a BC break or not? Ready for 2.7 or 3.0?

It's a BC break yes: any class specializing renderException by inheritance will need an update

@francisbesset This is indeed a BC break and can only be merged in 3.0... but is it worth it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm in favor of merging it in 3.0

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't see why not to merge it into 3.0.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by francisbesset at 2015-02-23T12:20:36Z

I updated the title of the PR to specify 3.0 but I can't update the base branch for the merge.
