One difference though is that `getCacheDir()` and `getLogDir()` are returning absolute paths. Here, we return relative paths.

I haven't thought about that ðŸ¤”  To me, "dir" can mean both relative and absolute, such as in this example:

![composer-dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/60871641-6f8c2c80-a233-11e9-99af-511efea0a5fa.png)

But if this is confusing to people, we can close this.

As `dir` stands for `directory`, it doesn't assume absolute or relative paths

> A directory is a "folder", a place where you can put files or other directories (and special files, devices, symlinks...). It is a container for filesystem objects.
>
> A path is a string that specify how to reach a filesystem object (and this object can be a file, a directory, a special file, ...).
>
> Example: you have (probably, depending on your system) a file where system messages are logged, called syslog.

> [ ... ]
