Hey!

I think @Simperfit has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

@Nyholm As it is now handled all in the `AbstractSessionListener` I added there the ResetInterface to handle it there. **EDIT**: Need to have a deeper look at this as currently some tests fails now.
@jderusse Sounds good for me did add a deprecation message to the class.

@jderusse I added a deprecation message but the CI is failing now because of that. Not sure if we can just remove https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/e2d1cb1d3ca5cc57315626f3e8c24a582ca460b6/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Resources/config/test.php#L38-L44  or if we should keep the test listener. What do you think?
