Not sure about this one. The goal of the profiler is to actually show the information about a given URL, so hidden it looks weird to me. Also, long URLs are not the norm, but rather the exception.

How about just removing the fixed height of the #resume bar, and displaying it like:

Removed the fixed height. So it is displayed like on the last picture. Short urls look like usual.
