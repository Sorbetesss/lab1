`app` is not really the kernel, just the name. In this case I'd expect to see `AppKernel`, would that be nicer to show?

If it's namespaced it can get messy.. but you're right; it's different information. Both are useful :')

What about;
`Symfony 3.2.0-DEV on \My\AppKernel(name: app, env: dev, debug: true)`

Or with verbosity;
```
$ bin/console -V
Symfony 3.2.0-DEV
```
 vs.
```
$ bin/console -V --verbose
Symfony 3.2.0-DEV on \My\AppKernel(name: app, env: dev, debug: true)
```

But im not sure thats common or even semantically correct..

I personally prefer the verbosity flag but I don't know how intuitive this is.

Another solution would be to remove the `name: app` thing and to not add the kernel info either.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There might be a lot more info about the kernel you'd want to see...  What about simply adding the version + release date (if available) and making an application info command? Not sure if this would be interesting for the core, but it might show nice things such as which bundles are enabled.

@iltar i was just thinking about that.. with `--verbose` we can go really crazy;

I'm afraid that eventually it will come down to this: We need a command line WDT variant

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2016-07-03T10:54:59Z

Agree, this is still not great as a header line when used with `bin/console`. So what do we need to show for `-V` then? (assuming everything is available with `bin/console info` in some time).

Perhaps kernel info is a  bit too specific indeed =/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-07-03T11:00:03Z

For now I'd say a limit of what's available in the `Kernel` constants. I would love to have more debugging info on the command line though, such as a CLI WDT. Maybe a nice feature for 3.2 (though I have no time to work on this).

~~removed kernel:info command~~

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2016-07-03T14:16:21Z

Please, let's focus first on finishing this pull request about the console header. Then we can discuss about the `kernel:info` command in a separate issue. Thanks!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2016-07-03T14:32:15Z

Done.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would not remove the app name here. You can have several one and being able to have it with `-V` is important.

Any news on this one?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-07-19T15:34:55Z

@ro0NL Still interested in finishing this one?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2016-07-20T06:26:05Z

Yes. Try to work on it today. As soon as my laptop is connected :(

Back up :) @fabpot it's going to be `Symfony 3.2.0-DEV (kernel: app, env: dev, debug: true)` then.. where `kernel` refers the kernel name, not the kernel type.

I think it makes sense.. if #19278 is accepted we have more detailed information anyway.

Maybe the minor UI change for console applications is worth noting..., not sure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-07-28T20:28:40Z

Tests should be updated as they do not pass with these changes.

Green :)
