> **A question remains**: should we display date/times in the user timezone AND locale; or on their timezone BUT always in English, like the rest of the interface?

What about making those as choice that user could change from profiler configuration? With that each user could choose how they want to show those.

I'd prefer to not introduce a config option for that. I don't think it's important enough to require a customizable setting.

The entire interface is (and will remain) in English ... so maybe it's better to just use English for this too?

I would not make this configurable. Local time always in English sounds good enough to me.

I also vote for keeping it in English like other parts of the interface

I've updated this PR:

* Dates/times now displayed always in English
* The existing `title` attribute of `<time>` is no longer removed
* The logger panel timestamps have millisecond precision again
