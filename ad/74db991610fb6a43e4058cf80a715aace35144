I added a not directly related commit to this:
I propose loading the `dump()` function declaration as soon as the `VarDumper` class is loaded.
Since this class is used by `DebugBundle::boot()`, this has the effect of autoloading the function when the bundle is loaded.
This ease the upgrade path for existing projects since they are not required anymore to inline the definition somewhere (in app/autoload.php in next sf-std edition).

The effect of this change (see symfony/symfony-standard#732 also) is that if an application has a call to `dump()` somewhere, a Fatal Error will be triggered when the DebugBundle is not enabled.
This is a wanted side-effect (prevents data leak).
