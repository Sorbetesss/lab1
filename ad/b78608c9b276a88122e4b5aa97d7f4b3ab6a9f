-1 for making the helper stateful. this creates issues when you have several usages of the helper

btw, once #11122 is merged, you won't need the setter anymore

@stof You're right, I've updated the PR

this is not equivalent anymore as it now requires running in debug verbosity to see the output of the process. Do we consider it as fine, or should we add a new argument in ``ProcessHelper::run()`` to configure the threshold ?
I think it may be fine to change the verbosity level used by the command here
