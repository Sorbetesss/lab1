Another problem (maybe an issue ?) which is new in Symfony 2.2, it is the security.secure_random service. This service produce a good encryption, but in bytes when it is used with openssl_random_pseudo_bytes. The problem is that bytes is inusable as it in databases, without being encoded with bin2hex.

Maybe the security.secure_random need to have an option to encode in hexa instead of binary ?

Maybe tests have failed because I have reverted a commit ?
