Hum, it seems that this PR actually brokes tests...

Would using `0` break in the same way?

Huh, so `$active = null`, `$active = 0` and `$active` make tests for HttpClient timeout...

I don't understand why. It's a variable declared in a reference so it should be ok... Maybe because of a weird PHP configuration, it fails?
We really need to find a way to easily reproduce the issue and find a better fix than this... :/
