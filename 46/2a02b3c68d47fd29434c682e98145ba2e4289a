Seems a lot better! Is it possible to make a 2 column table (borderless) out of them so they align properly?

Yup, did it by hand because it's like 3 lines of code and the Table requires an output and all.. seemed overly complex for this.

Fixed feedback (I had to add a Helper::substr too, I hope that's ok).

@hason hmm yeah I guess if yours is merged it kinda makes this one obsolete anyway? I don't really have a preference, I guess this one is simpler but less powerful.
