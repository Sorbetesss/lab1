This would be a BC break or am I wrong?

@maxbeckers how? Are compiler passes configurators part of Symfonyâ€™s public API?

My two thoughts were renaming the class and changing the priorities. It's only debug compiler passes, but wanted to at least note it. That's why I'm not sure if it's a BC break or not.

@fabpot I see you changed the milestone to 6.3 but this PR is supposed to be a fix for a feature introduced in 6.2. Is that alright?

In that case, 6.2 is indeed the right target.
