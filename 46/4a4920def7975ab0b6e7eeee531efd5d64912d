On very long context it is impossible to read or scroll the log.

I don't know if it's the best way to handle it though.

I'm :+1: for the change. Thanks @HeahDude.

But I have a question: why don't you see the log contents in several lines? This is how I see this:

I guess because it's an array with a single ~~key~~ value.

No, in fact I don't know :)

Ok I think I found it, working on a patch ;)

I pushed a second commit 209c819 which fixes it, now looks like:

Thanks for working on this. However, I'm not sure about the second commit. The `ValueExporter` class is used in lots of places. This could "break" other things.

@javiereguiluz sure, I understand.

Still, if this class is meant to ease reading while debugging, it may help to not inline arrays just because they don't have nested arrays, my captures are good example.

Let me know if I should keep it like this, discard or squash this commit. Thanks.

@fabpot What do you think of  1be25ab ? May it "break" things somewhere ?

The ValueExporter class is only used for the profiler, so I think it won't break anything. You can probably browse all the tabs from a profile to confirm that it works well everywhere.

Thanks, I can confirm. If I'm not wrong my commit only increase readability for inline arrays.
