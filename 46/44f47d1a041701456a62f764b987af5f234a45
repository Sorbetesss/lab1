As this method does returns a shape with 3 info and not just the docblock, I would not make it public. I don't think we want to provide BC for the current API.

Good point.
I suggest to create a new public method then with a simpler API. What do you think about that?

I think because it's not a component responsibility, as per current contracts.

Hm.. Im not sure I agree with that. You could expect the "property info" component to be able to extract the Doc Block of a property.

Or maybe I misunderstand you. Are you suggesting I should introduce a proper interface for this method?

Shouldn't you be using https://github.com/phpDocumentor/ReflectionDocBlock instead?

Yes, but there's no real contract for it currently

I looked into that. But I do like the feature from PropertyInfo component that would find where the docblock is. Ie, if the property is not documented it goes to the mutator.

I'll make sure to prepare a proper contract and prepare this PR.

I've updated the PR with a proper interface and a good return value.

Thank you for the reviews. I've updated according to the suggestions.
