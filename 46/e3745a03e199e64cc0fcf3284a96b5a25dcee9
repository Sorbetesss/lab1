Just wondering, for Symfony Docs, if this is merged ... should we change anything? In the stand-alone component and/or when using it as part of a Symfony full-stack app? Thanks!

@javiereguiluz I don't think the doc needs any update. This is fixing a bug for a specific case.

@javiereguiluz I don't think so, this is a bug fix.
