You should add this change to the CHANGELOG.md

:+1: but some tiny tests to ensure these methods keep being called would be good.

@Tobion can you give advice, maybe some piece of code how to do this? Bootstrap kernel without templating - where should I do it?

I don't mean functional tests but unit tests. We already have unit tests for this class. Just mock the container and ensure the methods are called.

And if the `twig` service isn't available? IMO the code should be something like this:

```php
if ($this->container->has('templating')) {
    // use the templating component
} else if ($this->container->has('twig')) {
    // use twig
} else {
    throw new \LogicException('You can not use the XXX method if the Templating Component or the Twig Bundle are not available.');
}
```
