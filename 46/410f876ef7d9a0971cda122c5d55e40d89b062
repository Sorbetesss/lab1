This is already covered by https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7b4d22f8d0bc443c2e972253250ebfb5ccdca499/src/Symfony/Component/Ldap/Tests/Adapter/ExtLdap/AdapterTest.php#L132-L135 . With a local LDAP runing, the test suite failed without this patch.

note: Tests are not executed in our CI=> This should be solved by #39030

This PR is about fixing the issue in case neither #38875 is updated with the correct fix, nor #39030 is accepted/ready to merge.
