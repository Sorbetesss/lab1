Hm I prefer explicit `return null`. I've met people that didn't know it's the same as `return` or no return and would argue `null` cannot be returned from this method.

Well, people need to learn PHP then.

:+1: being consistent and across projects, great!

:+1: for this (although I could agree with @Tobion), I prefer consistency over any specific style.

i too prefer `return null;`, as well as explicitly returning `null` at the end of a function if there are other return statements in it

i am with @jakzal and @Tobion :+1:

And what if an interface explicitly states to return either a value or null?

I prefer being explicit over implicit, too, but :+1: for the consistency regardless.

@sstok What do you mean? This PR is just about removing code that does not do anything.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by sstok at 2014-04-16T12:50:50Z

Well it wasn't clear if that was the case, as it stated `always use return; instead of return null; (the current code base uses both);` it wasn't clear to me if this also applies when you must to return null.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@sstok if you must return null just don't use return in the function and PHP will return null when the function ends.

@fabpot Given that fabbot already validates this, I suggest merging the PR to avoid having such changes done by all other PRs out there
