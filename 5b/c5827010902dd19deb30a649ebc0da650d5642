@bertterheide Now that the 6.1 branch is open, can you retarget it and resolve the conflicts. I would love to be able to merge it for the upcoming 6.1 release. Thank you.

@bertterheide @fabpot Hi, this PR seems stale but could be nice imho, can I try continuing the work on this?
Can be done in parallel of https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/46814

Since this has been inactive for a while, I assume it safe for you to continue to work.
Make sure to save the existing commits. Ie dont copy the work as your own.
