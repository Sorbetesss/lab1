Does it mean that @stof comments were wrong or fixed but Github does not show that? Sorry, I haven't re-read the PR.

@fabpot yes but we need to be very careful when merging to other branches (I can do the merge if you want).

@dunglas Ok, I Iet you merge this one and then merge to other branches, that will be much easier.
