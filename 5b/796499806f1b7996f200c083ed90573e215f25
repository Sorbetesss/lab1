Feel free to close this one in favor of an alternative by @boite if any.

Thanks @HeahDude I'll look these over and make sure they agree with some recent changes to the placeholder normalizer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-03-02T18:36:23Z

Yes I've already changed some assertions to take that into account ;)

:+1: Good work @HeahDude.

What was your reason for removing the final three tests in the single, expanded, required section?

Status: Reviewed

@boite Because when `ChoiceType` is expanded and required, it never has a placeholder.

see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.7/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Core/Type/ChoiceType.php#L356

Note to merger : only 2.x branches.

I suppose that if that code is unlikely to change then there's no harm in having removed the tests.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by boite at 2016-03-02T23:23:01Z

Branches 2.7 and 2.8 only.

yes, this precision was in the description ;)

Thanks for this PR @HeahDude :) What about the failing tests in the PHP 7 build?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-03-03T09:18:52Z

@webmozart I know I still miss to understand.

It's like the PHP 7 build of travis does not take into account commits of #17568 and #17973.

Any lead ?

@HeahDude That's because the tests use the form component from v2.7.10, which does not include the two PRs you mention.
