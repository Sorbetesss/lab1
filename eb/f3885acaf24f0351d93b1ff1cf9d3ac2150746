Is a default value of `false` the same as not specifying "safe"?

@cjunge I'm not sure to understand where this default value would be. Do you mean in the request or in the response?

Anyway, from what I understand from the RFC:
- either the client requests for safe content if possible or it requests a normal response
- either the server send a response with safe preference applied or it send a normal response.

There is no such thing as "prefering a not safe content" or sending a response with "preference not applied".
