Coincidentally I spotted this also yesterday :)
The namespace should be moved to a "use" statement.
~And we should double check that all methods we use on the object exist on the proxy.~
~I think at least"del()" is missing.~

Another option is to just remove the check for it. Wouldn't break anything since it never worked. Note that RedisProxy exists because the Redis class used to be incompatible with autogenerated lazy proxies. That's not the case anymore since phpredis 4.

@nicolas-grekas
I spotted this when testing [GAE](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/ ) with  [memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/).

the `__call` should do trick for `del()` right?
