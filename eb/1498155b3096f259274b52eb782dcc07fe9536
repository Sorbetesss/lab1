I like this change. It makes it easier to understand the differences between the two.

üëç Lot more descriptive (still a bit confused by "MarkingStore" but it's probably more correct if you're into the workflow nets)

The term is "marking" from the Petri net and that is something we should not change. But "store".. if we are not happy with it we can maybe could consider renaming it to "Strategy"

Actually, I made the `marking_store` configuration optional.

So this is the minimal config:

Workflow:
```yml
framework:
    workflows:
        article:
            supports:
                - AppBundle\Entity\Article
            places:
                - draft
                - wait_for_journalist
                - approved_by_journalist
                - wait_for_spellchecker
                - approved_by_spellchecker
                - published
            transitions:
                request_review:
                    from: draft
                    to:
                        - wait_for_journalist
                        - wait_for_spellchecker
                journalist_approval:
                    from: wait_for_journalist
                    to: approved_by_journalist
                spellchecker_approval:
                    from: wait_for_spellchecker
                    to: approved_by_spellchecker
                publish:
                    from:
                        - approved_by_journalist
                        - approved_by_spellchecker
                    to: published
```

state machine:
```yaml
        task:
            type: state_machine
            supports:
                - AppBundle\Entity\Task
            places:
                - backlog
                - in_progress
                - done
            transitions:
                processing:
                    from: backlog
                    to: in_progress
                done:
                    from: in_progress
                    to: done
```

As you can see, we never talk about the marking store.

---

About the class name: it really save / get the Marking from a POPO. So I prefer MarkingStore to MarkingStrategy.

Im also fine with "store". I just tried to consider the alternatives because Wouter pointed it out.
