You forgot to read the contribution notice, can you add those headers?

I was wondering if it would be a better idea to just change all usages of `list()`:
```
+ list($a, , ,$b) = $this->getVoter();
- list($a, , , $b, , , ) = $this->getVoter();
```

@keradus in case you need it, here you have an example of the table that must be included in the pull request description: http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html#make-a-pull-request
