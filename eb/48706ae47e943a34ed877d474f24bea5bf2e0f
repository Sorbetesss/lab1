So you don't think that this comment https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/11299#issuecomment-48082554 is a great idea ? (just not repeat "password")

@jakzal I've update your comments. Please review it and tell me if I have to change anything else.

@javiereguiluz we could have both methods, one for validate user password as you mention before and another to validate a password, due to could be a password not stored in the user object.

```php
public function isPasswordValid(UserInterface $user, $encoded, $raw);

public function isUserPasswordValid(UserInterface $user, $raw);
```

:+1: for @javiereguiluz comment, password is redundant.

@Nek- I think `security.password_encoder` is a name that reflects the serivce's purpose bettern than `security.encoder` (what kind of an encoder?). Then, the method names (`encodePassword`, `isPasswordValid`) are inline with the encoder factory, so probably what most users would expect.

I forgot to implements the PasswordEncoderServiceInterface.

@jakzal I added the Service prefix in order to prevent collision with PasswordEncoderInterface in the same namespace.

Do we need an interface here? It's a helper class and is unlikely to be overriden.

How about calling the class `UserPasswordEncoder`?

@jakzal :+1: to the class name `UserPasswordEncoder`

@jakzal changes made, and also passed the php-cs-fixer hope everything it's ok now

I like this implementation. @aferrandini we should also get a PR (or at least an issue) on `symfony/symfony-docs` for the changes (which will shorten things!). Can you create one of those?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aferrandini at 2014-07-05T13:21:27Z

@waverryan of course :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aferrandini at 2014-07-05T14:49:13Z

@weaverryan I added a PR to the symfony/symfony-docs repo with documentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@aferrandini you're on fire!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@aferrandini docs link point to the current repository (symfony/symfony). I think you should enter the full url `https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/3995`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
