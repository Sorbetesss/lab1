Since 2.7.0 is really a stabilization release (like all .0 releases) and 2.7.1 is about to be tagged, having this in 2.7.1 is the only window we have to get this fixed.

I am not sure if that is a good idea. Yes, it's not consistent, but do we really want people have to change their apps again if they already adapted the new `ChoiceView` class?

This should be documented as a BC break between 2.7.0 and 2.7.1 though

UPGRADE-2.7 updated. If someone has a better wording idea, I'm open to suggestions.
