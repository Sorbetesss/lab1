Please do not remove method, we first need to merge deprecation notices

@FlorianLB are you planning to finish this PR? The method mustn't be removed, but a depreciation error should be triggered instead. Have a look at other PRs of this type and also read [Javier's gist](https://gist.github.com/javiereguiluz/a5514ec6cde2a63be441),

No. Depreciation error must be triggered in 2.7 and deprecated method must be removed in 3.0.

This PR is about 3.0 not 2.7. I already did it and it has been merged (#12731).

Sorry, didn't notice the target branch. We're not removing the methods just yet.
