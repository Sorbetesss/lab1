Nice 👍 . Thanks for implementing it. I was wondering though. This solutions works only if the profiler token is on the same url. Why not pointing out to the link provided by the header ? (in a new tab maybe ?)

Yeah, good idea, I will update the implementation and use the x-debug-token-link header instead.
