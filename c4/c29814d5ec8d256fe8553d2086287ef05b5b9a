Oups, didn't see that someone already worked on it: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/28452

Just pushed a test case since it looks to be the good way to fix this issue regarding comments on the other pull request.

I pushed on master because it is a very similar issue as the previous one I fixed (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/28315) which was merged on master.
