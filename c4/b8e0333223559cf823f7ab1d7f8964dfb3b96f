Finally created a `ConcreteDumper` to test the abstract class as done is a few places:

- https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Tests/Authentication/Token/AbstractTokenTest.php#L33
- https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Tests/AbstractExtensionTest.php#L33

I think it is ready to merge.
