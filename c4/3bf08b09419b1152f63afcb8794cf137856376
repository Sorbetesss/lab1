I don't know anything about xpath but I think it's not normal tests fail because of one space.

@MatTheCat it is normal, because this XPath query asserts the text of the label, and you now have a space in it which was not there before

Should we use `normalize-space` then? Or should I add the space in tests?

I think you should add the space in the test. If we used `normalize-space`, we would not be able to detect future regressions.

I don't get why tests are failing past PHP5.5 =/

@xabbuh thus it would not work. ``normalize-space`` will change multiple spaces to 1, but there would still be a difference between 1 space and none

@MatTheCat we have an issue with the deps=low and deps=high tests. @nicolas-grekas is currently working on fixing them.
