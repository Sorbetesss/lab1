Not sure if this should be treated as a bugfix, people could use some specific array denormalizers, adding the generic one could make their application use it instead of their specific denormalizers leading to bugs.

This is very unlikely because:

* framework's array denormalizer has a low priority
* the suffix `[]` is not commonly used in denormalizers

However the bug is real and annoying. Anytime you try to deserialize a document containing an embedded collection, Symfony fails with a an error hard to understand for newcomers (`The property "foo" must be of type "Foo\Bar[]", "array" instead`).

üëç I always registered this one on my own in my applications, but having this done for me in core is much nicer.
