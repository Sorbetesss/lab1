All performance gains are more than welcome ... but please always use realistic benchmarks. Nobody is going to display 1 million rows in a console table ðŸ˜±   Thanks!

Of course :) just wanted to check the impact it has. Basically switching to yield and avoid array merging and such; we gain memory.

Point is with iterable support we allow for lazy loading rows, i.e. i can build the row when needed (which can be heavy action by itself).

Moving to 4.1. Rebase on master might be needed, where PHP 7.1 features can be used btw.
