By the way, this PR is a perfect example of why the tests were used to run against a specific Intl version. ICU data changes way too often and it's hard to maintain tests that would run across versions.

[This is interesting.](https://3v4l.org/sT7ia)

```php
foreach (array('UTC', 'GMT') as $timeZoneId) {
    $tz = new \DateTimeZone($timeZoneId);
    var_dump($timeZoneId.': '.$tz->getName());
}
```

Output for 5.5.10 - 5.6.30, hhvm-3.10.1 - 3.19.0, 7.0.0 - 7.1.5:
```
string(8) "UTC: UTC"
string(8) "GMT: GMT"
```

Output for 5.3.0 - 5.5.9:

```
string(8) "UTC: UTC"
string(8) "GMT: UTC"
```

Edit: indeed, this behaviour was changed in PHP 5.5.10: https://evertpot.com/php-5-5-10-timezone-changes/

This is ready for review.

To make my life easier [I prepared docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/jakzal/php-intl) with various ICU releases and PHP versions compiled. Might be useful for others too.

Usage is very simple:

```
docker run -it --rm \
  -v `pwd`:/symfony -w /symfony \
  jakzal/php-intl:7.1-59.1 \
  ./phpunit /symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Intl/Tests/
```

Where 7.1 is the chosen PHP version and 59.1 is the chosen ICU release.

@jakzal Great for the Docker images! Can you add the URL and usage somewhere in the component itself so that we don't forget that these images exist?

Added the link to docker hub to the Resources section in the readme. As usage is documented on docker hub I didn't want to duplicate it here.
