Did you check if this problem exists on 4.4 as well? If yes, we need to fix it there.

@derrabus looks like it! https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Dumper/Preloader.php#L90-L92

Can you rebase your changes on 4.4 then? If not, that's okay as well. I can do that while merging.

Oh, and thank you very much for your PR, of course. ðŸ˜ƒ

I rebased it now. Will you port the fix to 5.1 then?

The branches are merged periodically. Changes merged to the 4.4 branch will also be shipped with the next 5.1 release.
