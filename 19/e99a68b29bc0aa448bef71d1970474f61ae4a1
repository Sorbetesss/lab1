> Should I create a new CHANGELOG-6.1.md?

Only the component/bundle/bridge changelogs need to be updated for new features.

Can this be done without the need for a controller/temp files using data URIs to embed the file in an anchor tag or is there another *frontend-only* solution?

Could this work? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/283956/is-there-any-way-to-specify-a-suggested-filename-when-using-data-uri

@kbond If I remember correctly, I tried embedding it in the url (I built this about a year ago, so not entirely sure). I believe it causes issues when the content is too big and it gets cut off from the url by the browser.

I just tried with a larger pdf (700kb) and it worked in the latest chrome/firefox:

```twig
<a href="data:application/pdf;base64,{{ pdfContentsBase64Encoded }}" download="desired-filename.pdf">Download</a>

@kbond Sorry for the late response, I got a bit distracted.

> did you test this in the context of a "real app"?

Yes, I just tested it again with the code changes. Seems to work perfectly :)
