For the travis failure, it is because Travis updated their PHP version, and PHP broke BC in patch releases for the serialization. I asked the PHPUnit team to build a new version of the phar with the fixed version of the mocking library (should be done soon) and then I will ask the Travis team to update their phpunit version
