I just updated the description to clarify the proposal, it's not about `Bundle` suffix but bundle class name instead. So, you have a bundle named `AcmeBlogBundle`? you will have two namespaces for their templates: `@AcmeBlog` and `@AcmeBlogBundle`. The last one is specially useful when you're overriding a template that also extends itself, without configure `twig.paths` manually.

At the same time, you can from a controller or anywhere to load directly the template of the bundle or the overridden one in your app, without create extra templates or extra configuration to achieve it.

Feat. freeze is coming :) also we can use some preffix or suffix to achieve it, WDYT?

I don't dislike the idea ... but I'm not sold on it either. My concern is that you'll have two almost identical namespaces that are completely different: `@FOSUser`, `@FOSUserBundle` ... which one should I use? I already have a lot of problems remembering if the namespace contains the `Bundle` suffix or not. If I see `@TwigBundle/...` in a template, I don't think I'll remember that it refers to the original template path of the parent bundle.

Another proposal that is easy to remember?

 * `!FOSUser`
 * `FOSUser!`
 * `FOSUserSource`
 * `FOSUserOriginal`
 * `FOSUserParent`
 * `FOSUserBundle`

This namespace should be used only to avoid the circular reference.

I share @javiereguiluz' concerns though I also do not have a better proposal.

Some random proposals:

```twig
{% extends 'parent@Foo/layout.html.twig' %}

{% extends '@@Foo/layout.html.twig' %}

{% extends '@Foo/layout.html.twig', { parent: true } %}
```

@javiereguiluz only the second one `@@Foo` can be possible right now as valid Twig namespace, I'll take your proposal, thanks.

It's not intuitive anyway, so we need document it.

@ogizanagi's suggestion sounds good to me too.

Perfect! I like this too, changed to `!` preffix :)
