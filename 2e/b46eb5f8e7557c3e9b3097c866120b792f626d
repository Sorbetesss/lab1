The common typo issue reported by fabbot.io is not a typo here.

The `Unit Tests / Unit Tests (8.2, low-deps) (pull_request)` uses the String component v5.3 making the Inflector component test failed. Should I have targetted the 5.3 branch instead of the 5.4?

(you need to bump the version of the string component in the composer.json file to fix the deps=low tests)

@nicolas-grekas you lost me on this because I don't know to which version should I bump the string component in the composer file of the inflector component as the PR fixes the string component. I obviously can't use 5.4.x-dev ...

The next version is 5.4.39
