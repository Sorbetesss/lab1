It doesn't seem to fix the [SecurityBundle tests](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/161308646#L3271) (should it?).

@jakzal this is because of per-component tests: the patch here is not used on the SecurityBundle test suite because SecurityBundle is untouched by the PR. This a corner case. But as far as I tested correctly on my machine, it will make tests green yes.

Oh, and the PR that should fix tests is #19986, not this one :)
