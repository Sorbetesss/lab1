This PR is a performance improvement.

The related ticket of the comment is a bug, and it addresses another topic, that's why I suggested it to be fixed on 6.2

The related PR was tagged as bug, but it's not. Message extraction works well, but slowly on some very large projects.

We must fix #49397 in a dedicated PR, targeting 6.2
