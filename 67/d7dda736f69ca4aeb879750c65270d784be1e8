`php ./phpunit src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/` is running fine locally, I actually don't know why this is failing at appveyor right now. Before the last commit the test was fine, I highly doubt that the last commit did anything concerning the HttpKernel test. Apart from the fact that it just reverted things to the way they were before the PR...
edit: seems fixed, thanks

could you please also remove the useless `null` default here:

various checks seem fine for me locally:
```bash
$> php ./phpunit src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/
#...
OK (231 tests, 679 assertions)
```
```bash
$> docker run -it --rm --name spu -v "$PWD":/usr/src/spu -w /usr/src/spu php:7.2.19-cli php ./phpunit src/Symfony/Component/HttpClient
#...
OK, but incomplete, skipped, or risky tests!
Tests: 245, Assertions: 511, Skipped: 5.
```
```bash
$> php ./phpunit src/Symfony/Component/ErrorHandler/
#...
OK (64 tests, 196 assertions)
```
php version 7.2.20

@tweichart don't worry about AppVeyor's failure, it's not related to your changes.
