As long as it’s clear in your documentation PR I think it’s okay 👍

@insidestyles what I meant is only one class here but two service definitions within [the DoctrineBundle](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle) where you need to register the services (in the `messenger.xml`).

I understood. Should I revert the last commit?

I also created https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/pull/956

@sroze what Symfony version are you targeting with this? Is this still eligible for 4.3 or will this land in 4.4 by default?

I will stop merging new features for 4.3 probably at the end of the week. But I would really like this one to be part of 4.3 :) We need some approvals.

> Can you add a note in the CHANGELOG as well as the `@experimental in 4.3` annotation on the two classes, please?

@sroze Done.
