@nicolas-grekas That would require to make them autowired, right?

Correct, bad idea :)

What about making it easier to define the default name of a command, by asking people to just fill in a
`protected static $defaultName`?

Here is a commit doing this to see what it could look like: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/05c922a33ade30ba59af8a9e43ea3a04dde578ae

Note that this also "fixes" an issue with inheritance, where the return value of `getDefaultName()` can be provided by the parent class, which usually is not desired. This also means we could just remove the interface btw.
