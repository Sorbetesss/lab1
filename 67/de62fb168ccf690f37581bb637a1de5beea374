Hey!

I think @greg0ire has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

@neclimdul please also report that to PHP. I think the behavior deserved being fixed in PHP, even if we can work around it.

Sure thing. Not sure this sort of thing will get a lot of attention but it would be a good fix in some future version of PHP.

Can you please target 4.4, and fix all calls to the function (there are more in the codebase)?
