Cookie in BrowserKit has the same issue isn't it?

@nicolas-grekas I've made that change too. However, when copying the `testToString()` test from HttpFoundation, I needed to fix all tests because the results are pretty different from the HttpFoundation tests. Are those differences expected?

Examples:

```php
$cookie = new Cookie('foo', 'bar', strtotime('Fri, 20-May-2011 15:25:52 GMT'), '/', '.myfoodomain.com', true);

// in HttpFoundation
(string) $cookie = 'foo=bar; expires=Fri, 20 May 2011 15:25:52 GMT; domain=.myfoodomain.com; path=/; secure; httponly'

// in BrowserKit
(string) $cookie = 'foo=bar; expires=Fri, 20-May-2011 15:25:52 GMT; path=/; domain=.myfoodomain.com; secure; httponly'
```

```php
$cookie = new Cookie('foo', 'bar', 0, '/', '');

// in HttpFoundation
(string) $cookie = 'foo=bar; path=/; httponly'

// in BrowserKit
(string) $cookie = 'foo=bar; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/; httponly'
```

@javiereguiluz your first example outputs the same cookie. Attributes are just given in a different order. But order is not meaningful.

@stof yes, the first example is the same, but with a different ordering. But I think it should be exactly the same. The attention a project pays to details like this says a lot about a project ðŸ˜„
