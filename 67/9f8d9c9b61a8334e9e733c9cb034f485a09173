Running `grep getFallbackLocales src/ -rl` on the repository spots the usages, that's where we should start.
On Linux, you should use `chmod 644` with the name of each file (honestly, I don't know how you ended up changing the mode of these files, maybe some unusual configuration like @stof hinted about?)

Maybe i should not have started this PR... im a bit confused  what is need to be done exactly..

e.g  https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Command/TranslationDebugCommand.php#L321 here ... should this whole method all so be removed and all the stuff who uses tha catalouges too https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Command/TranslationDebugCommand.php#L200

I think there is an easy way to finish this PR, which is reverting the deprecation and add `@internal since Symfony 4.2` on the method instead. This would provide the same.
