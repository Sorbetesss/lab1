The class is not final, are we sure we want to change the type here as a bugfix? I think it should target 6.3.

I think this is fine for 5.4: this is an obvious mistake, let's prevent ppl from building on it (I doubt anyone overrides this method anyway).

Do you know the reason why CI fails for 8.1, high-deps? Do I need to change smth?

No need, it's unrelated.
