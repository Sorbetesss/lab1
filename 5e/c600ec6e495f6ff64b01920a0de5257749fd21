Should the `is_callable()` call in `setAttributeValue()` also be changed?

@xabbuh denormalization does not seem to be affected.

Doe we have a test case for this? Otherwise it could be helpful to add one in this PR

I was wrong! Good catch @xabbuh. Managed to reproduce it, but had to take a different approach: `method_exists` does not see protected/private methods, which are expected to be set by the Normalizer during denormalization. So I'm keeping `is_callable`, but catching the exception when Reflection fails to recognize the method existence.
