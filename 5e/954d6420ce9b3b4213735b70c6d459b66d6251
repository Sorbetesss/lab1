Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.1 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

I have found out that the lowest branch where this fix can be applied is 5.2. Should I close this PR and create the new one for the 5.2 branch?

5.2 is not maintained anymore, so 5.3 is probably the lowest maintained branch where this applies.
Assuming you have a remote pointing to this repo named `upstream`, you can just change your base branch using the `Edit` button on your PR title, then on your machine run `git rebase --onto=upstream/5.3` on your branch and finally `git push --force`.

Thank you @chalasr! Done.

Could you review it again?
