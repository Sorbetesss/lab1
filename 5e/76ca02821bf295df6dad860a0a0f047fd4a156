To help others understand the context of this PR, it would be great if you update the title as a new proposal, rather than focusing on it as an issue. Also, a good description is very appreciated, as it will help document the feature later on.

I think what you have achieved here is a better error message when an empty query string or an empty request payload is sent, and the targeted parameter is not nullable and doesn’t have a default value. In this case, the Serializer denormalizes the empty input as an empty object instead of just returning null, thus triggering the validation with a detailed error message.​

This is the critical code:
```php
class Controller
{
    public function __invoke(#[MapQueryString] FooDto $foo) {}
}
```
Before -> Exception without message
After -> Exception with detailed message

@yceruto your last comment made me realize I may not achieved what I was hoping for. I have to clear out test cases and get back to you next week.

Hi @yceruto, sorry for delay and possible confusion. I had to review test cases if they cover expected scenarios.

@yceruto how do you guys deal with random test fails (8.4) or tests that fails only with one pipeline (8.2, low-deps)?

@yceruto @GromNaN what about 8.4? Is that fail irrelevant for now?

They are unrelated, so you can ignore them.
