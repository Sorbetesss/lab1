My concerns are here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/20938#discussion_r92873633
So if you considered them but still think this should be the way to go, I'm OK.
(which means I'm +0 :) )

if bundles need to support SF 2 & 4 and are bothered about this "strict" attribute, they can very well have two different xml files.

if they need to support both 2.x and 4.x, they cannot rely on the ``strict=false`` feature anyway (as it is always string in Symfony 3+), and so they can omit the attribute even in 2.x (as the default behavior of 2.x is the one we kept).

üëç about this.
