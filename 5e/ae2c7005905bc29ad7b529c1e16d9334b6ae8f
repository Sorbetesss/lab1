To me, it should be ok to change even when a protected property is involved: existing code won't break all of a sudden because of the less restrictive type hint. In any doubt, just to it in another PR to have this one merged earlier is this needs to be discussed.

Alright, will do it in separate PR.

Also I didn't bother with deprecated classes like ContainerAwareEventDispatcher.
