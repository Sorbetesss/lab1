The argument is not meant to become mandatory, but to instantiate an `ArgumentResolver` if none is provided, according to the deprecation message

@stof you're right.

Minor addition, @nicolas-grekas has added the service resolver, but this one isn't added to the default set.

@iltar that's expected, as this ServiceResolver requires some wiring, it is not standalone. So using it requires configuring the resolver externally and passing it to the kernel (which is what FrameworkBundle does for instance)

@stof fair enough, I see that the dependency is optional as well. I got confused because it's between the other resolvers here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/Controller/ArgumentResolver

fabbot failure looks legit

@nicolas-grekas indeed, should be fixed now!
