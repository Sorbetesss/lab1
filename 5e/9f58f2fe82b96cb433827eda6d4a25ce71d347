@nicolas-grekas Any idea why the `deps=low` build is failing?

@xabbuh the phpunit-bridge is not required in several composer files such the one of the framework bundle (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/composer.json).

Anyway the tests probably won't pass as long as this isn't merged.

@Ener-Getick we have a special phpunit launcher performing a local composer-based installation of PHPUnit (to remove unnecessary dependency which would hurt us, for instance ``symfony/yaml`` as we don't want to run tests on the version shipped in PHPUnit and we don't use the PHPUnit feature needing it). This special wrapper includes the bridge in the phpunit installation.

@xabbuh looks like the PHPUnit setup installed the 3.1.0-beta1 version of the bridge, and so does not use the updated version of the bridge: https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/133035973#L578

@stof thanks for the explanation, I didn't know that.
