@nicolas-grekas would be less obvious IMO. But we are touching subjective PoVs here :)

👍  for Nicolas suggestion (there can also be only one error, let's keep it simple).

I prefer your option @chalasr, what about just the actual rendered error? i.e. we remove this message.

I think the message is good as an intro to hint this does not directly relate to the command being run.
A colon looks fine to me :)
