Could the build please be restarted? I squashed a commit on the fork branch.

@Bouwdie the build is triggered automatically on push. I restarted it nevertheless.

The [failure is legitimate](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/155322085#L2836) (it's introduced by this PR).

@jakzal thx for restarting them anyway! I should have taken the behaviour of is_callable into account.
https://3v4l.org/j8CBb. The test opened something up that already occurred if a non-static method was given as callback.

@jakzal Everything is working correctly and the build succeeds. Is there anything more i can do to speed the review process?
