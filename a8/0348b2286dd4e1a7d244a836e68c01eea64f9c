> Should I add the small black top header with the Symfony logo too?

If that's not too much work, I'd say yes. :)

Black header with logo may confuse when Debug is used as standalone component.
Will this be merged until 3.3 release?

If we don't want to add the black header ... this should be finished. @deflock has a good point about not adding that header. I'm divided about that.
