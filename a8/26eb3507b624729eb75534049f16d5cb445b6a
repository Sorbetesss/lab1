You could also introduce marker interface like `interface Command {}` in your application.

@javaDeveloperKid thanks but this feature as stated in description is about avoiding marker interfaces and any inheritance. Introducing a marker interfaces would be additional coupling and changing the code to adjust infrastructure related setup. At this point I believe it's better and cleaner to define wildcard namespace in routing. Considering the fact that such configuration have influence only on senders it is purely infrastructure thing.

Sorry it looks like I don't know how to use `git rebase` properly
