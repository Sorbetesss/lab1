@HeahDude thanks for this fix (and for everything you do for the Form component).

Just a minor comment: it seems that the `| Bug fix?      | yes/no` row disappeared from the PR description table (it is usually displayed after the `Branch?` row). This information is important for mergers. Could you please include it? Thanks!

Failures seem unrelated.

`TwigBridge` dependency to `EventDispatcher` seems to be broken with php 7 build in travis.

@HeahDude Can you check if rebasing fixes the tests?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-03-19T12:31:25Z

@xabbuh It did. Thanks!

Ok there was a reason why I use `assertEmpty`, it's because `$extraData` in as empty array while `$viewData` is an empty string.

I fixed the assertions accordingly.

Rebased and squashed! Needs a final review here. Thanks!

There is a little failure in Doctrine bridge because it needs that PR to be merged first.

I've updated the dependency to `2.7.12` but travis does not seem to be aware of it yet.

Is it OK ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-04-01T11:16:56Z

@xabbuh Done, let's wait & see :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-04-01T11:21:48Z

Nope :(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-04-01T11:26:05Z

@xabbuh Can this be related to the last releases messed tags ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2016-04-01T11:44:43Z

@HeahDude This looks good now (the `deps=low` job is passing).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-04-01T11:46:48Z

Great!

Any news here? Waiting for this fix so I can upgrade to Symfony 2.8.* :)
