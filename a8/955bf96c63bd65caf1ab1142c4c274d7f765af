There's 1 Failure only for PHP 5.3 (https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/17702052#L501) - is it Monday and the test started in one second and finished in another and that's the error?

don't worry about this particular test. We merged a fix for such timing failures in the 2.4 branch, but the 2.4 branch has not yet been merged into master since this fix.
