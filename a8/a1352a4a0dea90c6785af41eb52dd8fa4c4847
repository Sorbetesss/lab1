@nicolas-grekas this still does not fix the case of ``null`` for types loading choices in a different way (even though they should probably change the default for ``choices_as_values`` in this case, avoiding the issue)

@stof thanks for a hint I think that's the simplest way and EntityType already have it. Just found PR from last night (but it needs more thought) https://github.com/symfony/propel1-bridge/pull/1

FWIW I ran into the same error condition in #16792 using a combination of the Form component 2.8 and Doctrine bridge 3.0 with the EntityType and this PR fixed the error for that case.
