this implementation is wrong. the Twig_Environment should not be configured through the TwigEngine, as this means that the ``twig`` service is not configured fully whne using it directly rather than using the templating component

I see your point, but do we have a better place where we can call methods of the Twig extensions?

@xabbuh Well, there is 2 solutions here:

- registering the Twig_Extension_Core explicitly (so that we have a private service for it)
- using a service configurator to apply the logic. An example can be found [in DoctrineBundle](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/blob/v1.3.0/ManagerConfigurator.php) used [there](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/blob/v1.3.0/DependencyInjection/DoctrineExtension.php#L463)

@stof Thanks for pointing me towards service configurators.

I addressed @Tobion's last comments and added an entry to the changelog.

@stof what do you think about https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/13554#discussion_r27109500

By the way, why is the DependencyInjection component not a mandatory requirement? Does this make sense at all?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ping @symfony/deciders Would be nice if we could get this into 2.7. Bumping the DependencyInjection version imho could be discussed afterwards.
