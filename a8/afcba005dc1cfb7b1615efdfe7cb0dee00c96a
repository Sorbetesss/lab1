in fact, the issue looks related to lazy command loading given `ServerLogCommand::isEnabled` is called :thinking:

looking at `Application::get` we call `add($lazyLoadedCommand)`, but `add()` itself doesnt register if it's a disabled command, yet `get()` happily returns $lazyLoadedCommand anyway. Causing `server:log` also to look available in `bin/console list`.
