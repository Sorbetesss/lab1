#25107 is related to search not detecting the characters after the \\. It is not an uppercase problem.

@Vinorcola it is actually the same issue - in FQCN letter after backslash is uppercase and that's the reason why it's not searchable - if you would create class starting with lower letter it would work correctly

@jzawadzki could you please rebase on 3.3? 3.2 is not maintained anymore (I already changed the base branch here on github).
