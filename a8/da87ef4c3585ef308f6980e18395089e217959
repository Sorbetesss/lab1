Some unrelated tests fail on local environment and here. :thinking:

[edit]: I removed the latest commit as it make a lot of test fail. But fabbot is not happy anymore... Let me know if I need to update them.

Nothing to do in your side, unless you want to fix them in a separate PR ;-)

They seem unrelated to your changes here and should be ignored, in my opinion.

Thanks for your review @yceruto :-)
And the difference between nested and lazy options.

It seems something is wrong with the tests. Could you please squash your commits so that the tests are triggered again?

I have squashed my two last commits.

I won't be available the next two weeks because of holidays. But I will be able to make any required changes when I come back. :-)
