> üëç , but why not 3.4?

no objection for me, 4.0 was the target of https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/25133.
The trait could also give these hints only if `class_exists(Flex::class)`, not sure it's worth it though, let me know wdyt.

As a general rule of thumb, almost all PRs that target 4.0 should really target 3.4: both versions share the same bugs (with rare exceptions.)

Note that symfony-standard exists in 3.4, these suggestions would be wrong there.
