[This comment](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/367aa1df6caa2c739a58165ead81e7fe50e6599e/src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Constraints/Composite.php#L23-L25) let me think this was at least considered a valid use-case despite not being the main motivation.

What do you think @xabbuh?
At least, if we truly want it to be internal, we should remove this comment as well.
