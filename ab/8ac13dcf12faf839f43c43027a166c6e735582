`propertyPath`?

edit; perhaps for sake of the explicitness `valuePropertyPath` :)

@ro0NL: I hesitated. It should be obvious it's the property path to the value to use in comparison, and not anything else. I can't really explain why I had some reservations on this naming. Let's see what people do prefer.

Updated to use back `propertyPath` for the new option name, as it's the common naming we've got in the core for this (original proposition was `valuePath`). Unless there is a debate about another naming, this should be ready.
