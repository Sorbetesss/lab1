Now I'm wondering: do we want to deprecate named locks? Why?
The original issue was only about the default lock.

I believe the issue #38458 is about removing Lock in favor of LockFactory and not only the default one.  /cc @lyrixx

I think arguments pointed in the issue are valid for **both** default lock and named locks. We should deprecate all of theme because they are dangerous/confusing for end users (no concurrency between services). And easy for end-user to fix:
- inject the factory and call ->createLock() in the constructor
- or create the service themselve `$services->set(LockInterface::class)->factory(LockFactory::class, 'createLock')->args(['default'])`
