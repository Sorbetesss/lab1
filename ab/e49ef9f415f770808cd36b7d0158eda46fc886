New scripts added in `en` but not in any other locales ? Do we have a bug in our importer, or are they shipping en-only data in the ICU release now ?

@stof indeed only `en` locale seems to be updated in ICU. Example: http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/tags/release-62-1/icu4c/source/data/lang/pl.txt

Too bad that the ICU data were not sent to translators before the release...
