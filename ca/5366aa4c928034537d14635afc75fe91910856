~When i played with UuidV4, i tried RandomString but found the instanciation time a bit long... could it be kept statically or is this not worth the short ?~

Update: i made some benchs (should have started with that, sorry)  locally, and the difference after ten million call is about 4% .... in favor of Randomizer.
