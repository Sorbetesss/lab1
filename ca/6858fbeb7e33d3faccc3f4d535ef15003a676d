IIRC, for PHP 8.3, we went with non-experimental immediately (or almost), and this worked really well.
I'd be in favor of doing the same for 8.4. This means of course fixing deprecations first and @alexandre-daubois is on it apparently ;)

We should remove the experimental flag as soon as we have a green testsuite (even months before the 8.4 release). But having a CI job running while the work is done on deprecations is easier (and allows actually checking that the PR solves those)
