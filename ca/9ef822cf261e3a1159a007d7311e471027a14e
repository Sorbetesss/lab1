Great. Thank you.

Your reproducer repo is helpful indeed. Could we do a test here on this repo too? Just to make sure this never breaks again?

Do you have an idea how to test it?

AppVeyor runs the tests only with PHP 7.2.5.
Travis cannot run the tests on Windows.
GH actions fail with this message: `Error: Container operations are only supported on Linux runners` (see https://github.com/villfa/symfony/runs/1336114965)

Hm. Iâ€™m not sure. @derrabus maybe have some input?

Maybe start by adding the same github action test as in your test repo?

@Nyholm PHP 8 on Windows does not happen on our CI yet. If someone with a Windows machine could confirm the bug and the solution, I think we can merge this without a test.
