@Nyholm The fix seems indeed correct to me. The other providers are affected as well (see #35095 for instance on the same topic). If you can fix it for all providers in this PR, that would be great! Thank you.

Sure, I will.

Thank you for a quick reply

I fixed other providers and rebased the PRs.

@fbourigault Could you review please?
