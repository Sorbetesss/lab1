@lmatte7 thanks for contributing this (and congrats on your first Symfony contribution!)

In order to update the Symfony Docs about LDAP, we'd need to know which changes are required to use this feature:

* This is the doc when using LDAP as a stand-alone component: https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/ldap.html Should we just add this new option to the list of options? If so, which is the default value of this option?
* This is the doc when using LDAP as part of a Symfony app: https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/ldap.html  Do you think we should change/update anything?

Thanks a lot!

@javiereguiluz thanks for the comment, I'm excited about being able to contribute!

Looking at the current docs I don't believe this option will need to be added specifically to any page. [This](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/ldap.html) page links out to show all of the available connection options, so as long as the option will be listed [here](https://api.symfony.com/4.1/Symfony/Component/Ldap/Adapter/ExtLdap/ConnectionOptions.html) it aligns with the current documentation.

As for a default option, I don't see one while looking through the PHP documentation or source code. I don't believe this option has a value until it is manually set by the code, and this aligns with my testing of this issue as well.
