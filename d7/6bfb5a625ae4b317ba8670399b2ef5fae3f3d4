I would consider this a feature, it is working without the ID and must wait for `5.4`.

I though to put this change as usual to 5.x branch, but checked "Maintenance" page (https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/maintenance.html) and it's sounds like it matches the rules.
Also 1 point to include this featurefix to nearest release, is the fact, that we cant fetch message id to reply/start thread in slack and this can be seen as problem.
