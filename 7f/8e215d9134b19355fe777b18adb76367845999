did you test it?
AFAIK, adding the `cache.pool` tag requires a special order and list of arguments on the constructor, which is not the case here (esp $namespace first), isn't it?

Yes, tested in a real project! And you're right about the ArrayAdapter argument thing, but it was already taken into account:

> There's no simple way to disable caching (e.g. in the dev) environment.

Why not using ``NullAdapter`` instead? using ArrayAdapter will cache the values, even if it's only for a request, isn't it?
