I'm :-1: on these changes. In theory, I agree with them, but as it makes merging more complex, and makes diffs between version non-readable, I think leaving them as is is the best thing to do. For new phpdocs, we should stick with the new "rules".

Of course, I understand and expected your comment ðŸ˜… .
If those changes are actually rejected, maybe we can at least keep the ones about adding the `@throws Throwable` and associated descriptions for PHP 7?

Fixes on current docblocks are indeed acceptable :)

This looks wrong to me. We don't document "rethrowing"

> this should be removed entirely actually. It does not make any sense to document that it throws an exception when the inner code threw an exception. PHP does not require each class to document exceptions thrown in called codes (unlike Java)

My opinion on this is that it matters only when it has value for the end user.
`Application` is an entrypoint. It may be useful to know if it handles gracefully or not exceptions for you, especially if it is conditional (the `catchExceptions` flag).

So, I'm not trying to be stubborn here, but simply explaining my thoughts on this in order to get yours ðŸ˜ƒ

What should be done here now?

1. Merge as is: Adds the `Throwable` type and document under what conditions it's thrown, because it has a value for the end user, as Application is an entrypoint.
1. Remove  `@throw` tags from `Application::run()`, because we don't document rethrowing at all
1. Something else?
1. Close this PR
