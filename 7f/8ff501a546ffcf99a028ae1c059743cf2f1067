Not WIP anymore but trying to figure out why the tests suite segfaults on 5.3.3.

@hhamon Have you tried to relaunch the tests on Travis? Sometimes, it segfaults for no obvious reasons.

just forget about 5.3.3 by rebasing the branch, given the min version has just been bumped to 5.3.9 :smile:

Yep! Looks like the rebase did the trick :D
