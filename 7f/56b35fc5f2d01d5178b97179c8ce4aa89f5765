Also, would it makes sense to make this class more "flexible" like explained in symfony/MonologBundle#89?

see symfony/MonologBundle#94 for the bundle counterpart.

Just noticed that the class from the bundle uses the request instead of the request stack. I've made a second commit to use the request stack for the class in the bridge.
