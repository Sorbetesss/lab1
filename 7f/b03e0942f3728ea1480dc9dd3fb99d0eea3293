Hello and thanks for this pull request!

I'm not a big fan of a getter that modifies the inner property. Actually, I'd prefer to move the PHP binary detection in the constructor, and throw an exception in the `start` method in case `getCommandLine` returns `null`

That way, we don't change `getCommandLine` behavior and I'd be much more happy :)

Are you okay with this?

@romainneutron No problem for me. It's fixed :)
