Regarding #11279, would it make sense to make this service available in AbstractController? (could be for another PR)

@chalasr in practice a `Session` instance is always provided. With this alias ppl could at least type-hint a controller/action argument. Isn't it enough?

Indeed!

Do I need to rebase my branch on top of 3.4 or is it not necessary?
