The TravisCi failure seems strange to me. I added the new argument type `tagged_iterator` to the `services-1.0.xsd` (See: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/31321/files#diff-0e535437d820c04db5c34dcc4210e3da) and the XmlParsingException shouldn't occur. Maybe a caching issue?

(rebase needed also)

The failing job is checking out branch 4.4 and loading dependencies with your patch applied.
This highlights that FrameworkBundle 4.4 is currently not compatible with DI 5.0 in your PR.
That's what needs to be fixed.
