@Nyholm yeah, I agree with @derrabus comment. That's why I did not change the current Symfony behavior.

But now, everything is configurable, that's what many people want.

About a solution in pure PHP to decide or not... I'm not really convinced. The solution I propose fit my needs and is simple to use. Do you have real use case where it does not fit and you would need PHP to configure it?

@Nyholm I have fixed your comments, thanks.

I think the PR is ready now

Hello @symfony/mergers

The initial issue got 8 üëçüèº, 4 ‚ù§Ô∏è  and, this PR got 5 ‚ù§Ô∏è and @dunglas commented "A big +1 on my side." on the issue.

So without feedback, I'm planning to merge this PR by the end of the month, before the feature freeze.
If you are against it, it's time to raise your voice :)
