The failing unit test in PHP 8.3 seems to be a bug in PHP: https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/12589

It is a new feature and must therefore target 7.1 because of feature freeze period

Should we wait wait for a PHP bugfix before merge?

Changed the base to 7.0 (there is no 7.1 branch yet)

I think so, yes.

The PHP bug got closed, the new behavior is intended. I updated the pull request to handle that case.

~~The PHP bug https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/12589 got reopened, so we should wait until that was resolved there I think.~~Â 
UPDATE 2023-11-13: was closed again

Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.0" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "7.1".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!
