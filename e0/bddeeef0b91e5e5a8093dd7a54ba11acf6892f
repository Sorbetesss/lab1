Thanks for the review, addressed everything. Added even more tests and fixed one from #30994 with some missing annotations as well.

I've added a new commit a54f389 which has two benefits:
 - reduce the complexity in the default factory by encapsulating the logic in the loader decorator (helped me spotting a bug already covered by tests)
 - lazy filtering, it means that when submitting empty data on optional field the choices won't be loaded or when some data is submitted and valid they will be partially filtered
