For `DateType`, the error situation cannot really happen because it is protected by the OptionsResolver anyway.

In `DateTimeToLocalizedStringTransformer` however, I propose to add a check in the constructor to ensure the validity of `calendar` when it is an integer just like the timezones, date format and time format. By doing so, we prevent any exception to be thrown when creating IntlDateFormatter.
