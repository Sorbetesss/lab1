I like this PR. Thank you
👍

Just and FYI:

In xliff we have `notes` and `target-attributes`. Here we introduce `sources`, `comments` and `flags`.

We maybe should have 4 standard thing keys that are shared over all dumpers/loaders.

Looks like the tests are broken by the features introduced in this PR. @deguif Can you have a look?

Please don't merge, I will rebase it once #30919 will get merged.

@deguif You can rebase this one now.

@fabpot this should be mergeable, test failures are not related.
