This makes me realize that any `%param%` could also be allowed there, not only env ones.
This means we need to add a ParamConfigurator, and that EnvConfigurator should extend it.
Then, the param() function should return a ParamConfigurator.

I cannot figure out why I get this error:

```
1) Symfony\Component\Config\Tests\Builder\GeneratedConfigTest::testConfig with data set "Placeholders" ('Placeholders', 'placeholders')
Error: Call to undefined function Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\env()

src/Symfony/Component/Config/Tests/Builder/Fixtures/Placeholders.config.php:7

```

That's because the function is not autoloaded. This means that we should force-load ContainerConfigurator in the loader.

I tried that before, but I failed "force loading it". Hm.. it works now. I think I have to blame this on incompetence.

But this means that a user will have the same issues. Before the ConfigBuilders, this was not an issue because the user would always use `ContainerConfigurator`.

The PR is rebased. Travis and Fabbot are both reporting on unrelated issues.
