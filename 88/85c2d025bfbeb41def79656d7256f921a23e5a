Sorry I wasn't clear enough. On legacy tests, calling deprecated code is expected! This PR is for 6.0:)

My bad, I hesitated and went for it as it's late, should be good now :) Not sure why it auto asked for review tho, sorry for the unnecessary pings :(

I just reviewed as I've sent the PR late yesterday, shouldn't I also delete fromStringProvider ?

It's still used in testCreateWithString, I don't know if renaming the provider is a good idea or not.

Good observation.

Let's rename it. There is no backwards compatibility issue with files in `/Tests/`

The rename should happen on 5.3 then!

Or better: don't rename

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh... let's not rename it then =)

Im happy with this PR in its current state.

I'm cool with not renaming it too.
