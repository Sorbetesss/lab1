Unless there are more comments that need to be addressed, it should be ready to merge then :)

Could you add an entry in component's CHANGELOG.md file?

@ogizanagi Done.

@ogizanagi Is there anything else that prevent it from being merged ?

@Lctrs : Nothing to me (appart from the comments I've just added, since the PR was tweaked since my last review). We just miss another approval (not mandatory here, but always good to take).

ping @symfony/deciders , @dunglas :)
