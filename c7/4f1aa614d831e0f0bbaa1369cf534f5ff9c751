@stof In #17599 you suggested to dump binary strings with the `!!binary` tag. Do you have an idea how we can best detect such strings (dumping with the `!!binary` should still be an opt-in feature though in my opinion).

@xabbuh PHPUnit looks for control chars to detect binary strings

@stof Thanks for the tip. I added support for detecting binary data and dumping them as base64 encoded strings (as an opt-in feature).
