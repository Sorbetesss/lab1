I was thinking about this as well. Can we update fabbot to enforce the usage of the class constant?

@xabbuh That's probably the job of PHP CS Fixer, and it's not trivial, see https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2918 for reference

Merging this up is going to be a huge one-time PITA, but I think we'll have a nicer codebase afterwards.

I will merge this one up. My strategy with such a PR is always the following: merge everything up, then merge the PR, merge up again and ignore all conflicts. Start again the work on branch n + 1, rinse and repeat.
