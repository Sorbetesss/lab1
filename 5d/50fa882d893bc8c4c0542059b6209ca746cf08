Even if it looks like a bug, I have doubts about whether this should go to `7.1` as an improvement.

the `composer.json` file to update is located in `src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel`

@xabbuh correct me if I am wrong but these unit tests on HttpKernel component runs with Serializer & ProperyAccess with version 7.1.x-dev, not with the code that are on the PR. That's why they fail.

@seferov Can you please rebase your changes on the latest `7.1` branch?

In fact, our pipeline is a bit more complex and takes the changes from the PR into account: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.1/.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml#L91

@xabbuh I see.

Btw, only 8.2 (high deps) is failing now. The rest is passing
