I don't understand why the 7.4 tests still fail with the same error.

As the status messages should never be used for anything, I think this should be done in 5.4 instead (aka not a bug fix).

The main problem are failing tests (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/43291/checks?check_run_id=3776657076#step:8:4317).

There would be the need to replace values of the XML https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xml

Or moving the XML into the project as a test resource and keep an old version for 4.4 to 5.3?

Good idea

I found the state of the XML of last month (from 2018) and added it to the project.
I'll create another PR for 5.4 (or 6.0?) to update the XML and actual message-texts in the Response class.

5.4 please

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> 5.4 please

It is a bugfix. How should it be fixed on 4.4?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by OskarStark at 2021-10-03T17:04:01Z

As @fabpot mentioned as no bugfix, it should result in 5.4 instead of 6.0.
While it is now considered a bugfix, 4.4 is fine

@OskarStark: @fabpot's comment was on the initial iteration of this PR, where the reason text was updated. That's not the case anymore and only tests are fixed (by making them used a pinned version of iana's xml).
