Does anyone know how to get the tests green without having to setup a kernel?

I know, but I don't know (yet) how to get green test suite. I'm still looking at the differences between 7.1 and 7.2 deps=low to find how to get green tests.

```sh
cd src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle
composer up --prefer-lowest --prefer-stable
../../../../phpunit
```

AppVeyor build failure seems unrelated.
