@dunglas thanks for the review. Actually Iâ€™m not 100% sure if this fix is good enough and will not break other things in Property Info. What do you think? How should I handle the breaking tests, leave as is now because it will be green after merge or I should split the PR?

Please bump `"symfony/property-info": "^5.1"` to `"symfony/property-info": "^5.1.1"` in `src/Symfony/Component/PropertyAccess/composer.json`.

That should fix deps=low tests. deps=high ones will be fixed once the patch is merged up.
