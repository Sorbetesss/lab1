I'm not very proud of how i changed the tests, i think i used a dirty trick.
The `FileValidator::factorizeSizes()` method is private and so difficult to use in test.
What is the best way of doing this sort of thing ?
Should i change the visibility of the method? Maybe extract the method in a helper object?
