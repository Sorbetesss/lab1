@dunglas https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/13505#issuecomment-93674629 :)

@aitboudad I know that but it can be considered as part of the "serializer groups" and "object normalizer" feature and those features have been released with the beta ;)

I think it's better to have polished features in 2.7 stable and this is some polish.

Btw the PR was open 8 days before the release of the beta.

IMO it's totally correct to have this in 2.7 as this is addition to new feature introduced in that version, so it's like "bugfix" ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aitboudad at 2015-04-21T13:31:37Z

well I think this can be considered as a bugfix.
@dunglas Is there a use case for adding `setters` supports ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by dunglas at 2015-04-21T13:45:43Z

@aitboudad it's a matter of taste but I think yes. In fact this PR is derived from a use case in a project I work on:
- I have 2 groups: one for normalization, another for denormalization
- I set my groups on interfaces trough annotations (so no property available)
- I like to put my denormalization group definitions on setters, I think it's easier to find them as it's a mutation operation than when they are on a getter.
