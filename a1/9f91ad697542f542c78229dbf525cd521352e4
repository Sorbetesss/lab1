I think I addressed all comments. How should I test this change?

I see [there's a test](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/29feb0091152fc84f14ff1bf8372c5646f74ae6d/src/Symfony/Bridge/PhpUnit/Tests/CoverageListenerTest.php#L7), but it assumes a currently used version of PHPUnit. Should this be enough?
