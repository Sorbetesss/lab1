> this does not add support when creating such iterator arguments from Yaml or XML configs

`ResolveTaggedIteratorArgumentPass` covers any `TaggedIteratorArgument` no matter if it's wired by the yaml/xml/attribute file loader, isn't it?

@chalasr the missing part is not the resolution. It is the support for the new argument added in the constructor (`$autoExcludeReferencingService`) where Yaml and XML files are currently unable to control it.

So, this changes the current behavior, but we're confident this won't break anyone, right?

Yes, at least I am :)

Anything else? :)
