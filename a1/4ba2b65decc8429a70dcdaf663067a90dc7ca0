Please add a test for this method with a form containing a button, to avoid regressions

I am a bit at loss as to know where(in what file) to put that test ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote a test for it but it's a fatal error.
That means that I have no way of catching the error nicely if the test fail.
If the test fail, PHP crash everything.

Do I add the test like that ?

Yes. I will still ensure that there is no regression (a fatal error crashing the testsuite is a failure for the testsuite, not a successful build)

Done

Hi,

Is there something else I need to do for the patch to be pulled ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,

Any reason why this pull request is still pending ?
What did I do wrong and how can I fix-it, if possible ?

Thanks

@mikeSimonson Sorry for the slow response. Could you please squash your commits into one? Please also rename the commit message to something more explicit, such as

> [Form] Fixed getErrorsAsString() when the form contains buttons

Otherwise this is good to merge. /cc @fabpot

I can still squash my commits while I have already pushed them ?

What's the appropriate way to do that without braking everything ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bschussek at 2013-09-03T13:30:06Z

Squash them and then do

```
git push -f origin patch-1
```

I hope it's good now.
