This patch seems to fix this issue: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/21559 that is present on v3.2.3

As you can see on blackfire:
[v3.2.2 to v3.2.3 patched](https://blackfire.io/profiles/compare/8222ecd2-6504-4487-9c90-fd83e9fb0ada/graph)
and
[v3.2.3 not patched to v3.2.3 patched](https://blackfire.io/profiles/compare/f6eba9c2-1d4f-4161-a3f7-96aed463a466/graph)

This patch still have a +2,39% negative impact on performance, but it's still better than +2020% of negative impact :-)
