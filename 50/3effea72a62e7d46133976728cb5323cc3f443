I think I've addressed the feedback so far, excluding one where I have a question about deprecation notices (which is the cause of the failing tests).

Is there any additional feedback now that the diff is a little tidier?

**Edit:** Fixed the deprecation warning failing tests issue too.

Failing tests come from current 3.4 branch (as of 3.4 being at  98dae3edb1ba8fa35c06a8c9a459e0ffb9105826).

We talked about including this on 3.4 and decided it was too late. As such, moving to 4.1.

I'll rebase against that tonight

Okay that's done now. (broken tests from master, again)

Time to merge @symfony/deciders ?

The deprecation also needs to be documented in `UPGRADE-4.1.md`, `UPGRADE-5.0.md` and the component's changelog file. But otherwise this looks good to me.

I'll update those tonight, or at lunchtime if I get a chance üëç

That should be the version numbers corrected in the deprication notices
