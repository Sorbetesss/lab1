@alquerci added handling of null and not-integer values, maybe some more tests should be added?

@alquerci is there any other change to be done? :)
Still, I don't know why the @carsonbot added the `needs work` label :thinking:

It was triggered by my last review pass https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/29532#pullrequestreview-185518870

Now the patch looks good except for the doubt I have:

> I have a doubt about how to handle null, because it could mean that the value is not set. Then, in that case removing the key instead of throwing an exception will do the stuff.
