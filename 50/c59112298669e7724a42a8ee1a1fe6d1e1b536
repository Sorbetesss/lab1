I didn't update the changelog because I think this is not common enough to require one. Also, this doesn't prevent *private* scalar services, because those don't get through the patched methods. That's why this won't break places where we do define scalar services.

Can we also deprecate scalars in `Container::set()` and `ContainerBuilder::set()`?
