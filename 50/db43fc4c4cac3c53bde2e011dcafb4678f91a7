It looks like reading `$context[self::AS_COLLECTION_KEY]` has the same issue.
Wouldn't it make sense to patch and use `getCsvOptions()` instead?

As in: make getCsvOptions() return two extra variables ?

I tried, but when it was time to update the test, I realized that getCsvOptions() returns a different set of variables in encode() v/s decode().
The original version seemed less invasive... and AS_COLLECTION_KEY will soon be deprecated.

My proposed changes are done, but I don't know how to correct the failing AppVeyor...
