What about all libraries which don't have 2 levels of root namespace to identify them ? there is lots of such examples:

- Twig (considering the old PEAR convention)
- Monolog
- Composer
- etc...

pear-style are checked only at 1st level of "namespace"
Lets wait for the first 1-level libs that need this feature and see how we can arrange for them.
