Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.4 for features".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

To access the Schedule, it has been decided to inject the transports via the locator service (`messenger.receiver_locator`). While it would have been possible to inject the schedules directly via the tagged locator `scheduler.schedule_provider` doing so would require memoizing the created schedule to avoid calling getSchedule() twice.
