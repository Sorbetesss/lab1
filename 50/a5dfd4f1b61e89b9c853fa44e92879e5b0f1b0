Last but not least, i think we should append each _wrapped_ listener to the call stack during **pre** process and lazy verify if it was called yes/no.

Currently it's added to the call stack during post-process which affects the order. I.e. the main kernel.exception is called before the sub kernel.reques, but we only collect that after the sub request finished.

@ro0NL Apparently, tests do not pass. Can you have a look please?

Let's see now :) i think it's a shortcoming of sf/debug not accounting for `@inheritdoc` :/

It's not a bug it's a feature. You must have to change your code when a lower layer decides to deprecate something. This is how.
