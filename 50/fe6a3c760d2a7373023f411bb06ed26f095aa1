This is a nice addition to ease debugging I suppose. I just don't think this is how you should handle these errors runtime though, might want to solve it without service locator?

Service locator is needed here. `TransportNotFoundException` should be handled by developer during coding/configuration. The problem is we throwing some specific exception and message of this exception can suggest available services. But it cann't without getting `private $alternatives`.
