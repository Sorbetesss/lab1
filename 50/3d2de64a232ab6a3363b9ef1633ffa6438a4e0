btw, the testsuite is catching the first 3 bugs I found when reviewing

Ready for an other round of review. I added a 2nd commit that removes useless tests for skips that will never occur thanks to composer and require-dev.

"low" and "high" tests are failing but after merge + subtree split, they should become green again.

Any vote? Once merged, I can take care of the merge in 2.5
