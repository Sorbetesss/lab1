Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.1 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Because this is a new feature, please target 6.1 (and then you can use `static` for the return type, since php 8 is the min version)

This seems backward compatible right? Isn't this meant to go to 5.x? (perhaps even lower).
Correct me if I'm wrong... I'm not entirely sure what processes there are to merge new features and bug fixes into compatible and supported branches.

This is a new feature, so this is for 6.1.
All the other branches are for bugfixes only (and adding a new method is never a bugfix)
