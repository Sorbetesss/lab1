Not sure we need this. So, I'm +0 on this one.

Any other opinions from @symfony/deciders?

I thought we already added a way to add docs to the validation a few releases ago? anyway, imho this is useful.

@WouterJ What's the status of this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I want to close/merge as many PRs as possible before 2.6. This one looks like a good candidate. @WouterJ Can you have a look at comments from @stof?

@fabpot of course, I was already working on it (after you last ping) but didn't finish it (as it seems). It's ready now
