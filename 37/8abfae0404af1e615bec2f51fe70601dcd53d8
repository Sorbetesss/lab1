to make it easier to upgrade, should we deprecate the old syntax instead of dropping it directly (which would even transform them to supported `smtp` DSNs using an invalid host for some of them, instead of failing cleanly to warn people) ?

@stof The component is marked as experimental. Moving to the next syntax is easy enough IMHO.
