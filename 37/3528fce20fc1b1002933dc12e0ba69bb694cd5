The Travis failure is particularly interesting. In debug mode, `PsrCachedReader` seems to behave differently than `CachedReader` does. 👀

Hey!

I think @Korbeil has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

He didn't manage that yet, though. He mentioned he has problems that tests discovered new cache having different behaviour.

I'll take the blame for that, since the difference in behaviour comes from doctrine/annotations providing the wrong functionality. They're supposed to have the same behaviour with different cache libraries.

The issue ~~should be~~ has been fixed by doctrine/annotations#412.
