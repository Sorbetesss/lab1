It could be considered as a bug fix as well.

Is it common to use DebugClassLoader within Drupal?

I don't know. I want to use it. A lot of people might currently use it and have not detected this problem because the incriminated class (`ClassFinder`) is only used in one core module.

But I don't want this PR to be treated as a request for Drupal. I will report the bad implementation to Drupal issues. It just gonna take forever before getting fixed.

The Debug component is here for a better DX. So it just seems logical to try our best in the `DebugClassLoader` to handle as many cases as possible when they don't overcomplicate things too much or have impacts on the added behaviors.

WDYT of my proposition to try to proxify every wrapped class loader methods ?
