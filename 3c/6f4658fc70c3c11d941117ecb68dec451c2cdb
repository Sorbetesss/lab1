Make a test using an actual Twig instance, with a template that has a `{% error %}` tag in its top-level content (so that rendering the full template triggers an error). This way, you will be sure that it was not rendered in full.

Thank you @stof!

had to remove the error tag (kept some ERROR text)... as the parsing of the tag made compilation fail.

ah sorry. We don't have the `{% error %}` in core, only the `{% deprecated %}` tag. I confused them.
