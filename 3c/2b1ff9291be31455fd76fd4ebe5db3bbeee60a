Note to self: Don't open three different PRs at once that change the same part of code, will save yourself a lot of work.

@mpdude Actually, that would have saved a lot of work for me as well :) At first, I didn't realized that the 3 PRs were about the same topic. In such a case, I generally ask to merge them all into one PR.
