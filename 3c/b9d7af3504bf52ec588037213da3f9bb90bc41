I have changed every translation except for Luxembourgish and Persian. I could not find a reliable translation for them.

I checked each translation against multiple websites, and reverse checked each one to make sure they made sense.

Thanks for the PR and looking into the issue. I'm not sure the translation values have to be changed or only the source (ie. key).

@1emming translations should be updated of course, to translate the right message.
