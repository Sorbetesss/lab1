I think we can simplify this to just replace the existing `elapsed` parameter with the new format. We do not promise backwards compatible CLI output, and I would argue that interactive elements like the progress bar should never be interpreted by any program anyways.

Thanks @wouterj and @OskarStark for your input. I now changed it.
