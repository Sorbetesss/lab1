A test case would be well deserved, adding a `simple` listener on a firewall in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/Tests/DependencyInjection/Fixtures/yml/container1.yml and updating the expected result should be enough. I will add it tomorrow morning if you don't before.

@chalasr I was looking into it. Not sure how I would actually do that. If you can point me to documentation on this part it would be much helpful. Otherwise, I must dig deep into test organization in order to figure out what to do.

rebase done, travis failure unrelated (Finder).
Note to merger: some SecurityBundle tests will need an update when merging in 3.4.
