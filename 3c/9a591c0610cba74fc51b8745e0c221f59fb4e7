Do we still have a test which ensures that deprecations are not triggered for nested anonymous definitions?

Yep :) https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22903/files#diff-25d0b562ad1c177bac8f4f9d0247b2acR7

it's tricky though due loose comparison of deprecations; if it triggered we wouldnt catch it (before it did by including the no. of occurences)

@ro0NL But this one is only tested in a `@legacy` test. So we would never notice when it accidentally triggered a deprecation.

@xabbuh extra test added
