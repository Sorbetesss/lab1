shouldn't we assume it is a ContainerConfigurator and trigger a deprecation warning instead ? Otherwise, it is actually a BC break.

I think you are correct @stof.. But that is boarder line overkill. =)

@Nyholm ContainerConfigurator already exists since Symfony 4.4 (maybe even earlier 4.x but I haven't checked). So I assume that this bundle might not be the only one out there using the feature without a typehint on the callable.

I agree that this would be overkill. Since this failure happens at compile time, we're not going to expose prod servers, so we can do it IMHO.
