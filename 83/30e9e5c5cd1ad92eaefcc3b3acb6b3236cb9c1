@ro0NL I don't understand one thing. How is it possible that the tests were passing without these fixes?

@enumag phpunit assumes FQCN by design. Ie. `@expectedException Exception` vs. `@expectedException \Exception` are equal.. however the latter works correct in **editors** (in terms of clickthroughs, at least for PHPStorm).

However _people_ tend to assume name resolution kicks in which causes false positives when doing stuff like

```php
use Some\LogicException;
// @expectedException LogicException
```

This works if `\Some\LogicException extends \LogicException` but is totally false positive.
