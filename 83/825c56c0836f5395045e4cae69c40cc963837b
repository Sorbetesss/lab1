should we change default names in a patch release?

This will break all URL generation that uses the existing names. So it might indeed be dangerous in a patch release

also, from my experience, dereferencing virtual route names is pure pain :D

Only when an action method doesn't end with `Action` nor `_action`, but still ends with `action`, in a case-sensitive way.

I'm fine doing this on 5.4...
