Can you make it work currently using only `php.ini` settings?

I do not really understand, wdym? Connect to amqp with ssl ?
If yes, it do actually work. The PR just allow amqps string (aws actually give you an amqps string only)

In https://github.com/php-amqp/php-amqp/pull/205, it looks like setting the `amqp.cacert` ini setting is enought to use SSL, isn't it?

I actually have added a new exception, I'm not sure it is useful and require to have a new PR merged first. The SSLException class, what do you think about it? Should I use a RuntimeException, a LogicException, or the new one?

@vasilvestre Can you check the tests please? They seem to be broken by the changes introduced by this PR.

Yes I'm actualling trying to search how we should handle ini parameters in tests, these are my own test, I think in phpunit.xml but the parameters should depend of system running tests, it could break on windows..
