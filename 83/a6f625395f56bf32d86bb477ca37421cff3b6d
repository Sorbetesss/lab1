Can this also be added for the PHP DSL loader? Really nice addition!

Thanks for the positive feedback!

@sstok
I added the same functionality to PHP DSL loader.

@nicolas-grekas

1. Changed target to master.
1. Modified the error message so that it refers to argument's name, type or both - depending on the configuration.

Does it mean I have to make changes in composer.json in my repository? It seems to be identical with the one from Symfony's repository?

Ping @przemyslaw-bogusz! Will you have time to check out the tweaks? We can hopefully get this into 4.3! :)

I will do it tomorrow, so I believe we can close it by the end of the weekend. Hope that's good enough.

@przemyslaw-bogusz do you have time to finish this or do you want me to take the rest of it ?

@nicolas-grekas, @weaverryan Thank you for your patience. If you have any additional comments, please let me know. I hope we will also be able to close #29944.
