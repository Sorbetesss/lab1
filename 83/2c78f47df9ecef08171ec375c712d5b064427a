We should prefer placeholders ``{name}`` and ``{id}`` which are compatible with [MessageFormatter](http://php.net/manual/en/class.messageformatter.php). See #11948 an #6009.

+1 for `{name}` and `{id}` which are compatible with MessageFormatter.

@hason This has nothing to do with MessageFormatter IMO. They are not translation placeholders here. They are used to build the translation key.

I vote for keeping the ``%`` syntax here.

And I'm :+1: for this. It would be useful.

@webmozart it would be great to create the doc PR

We should probably unify the placeholder syntax with 3.0. It doesn't make sense to introduce a *third* syntax (`{var}`) when we already have two.
