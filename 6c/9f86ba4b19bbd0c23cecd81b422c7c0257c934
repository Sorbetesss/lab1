I'm not sure about this one. If you don't want interference with the toolbar, just close it. With this change, how do you navigate to the toolbar menu without mouse?

@Tobion OK got your point and I could agree .. but we have to implement access key to show/hide the toolbar then .. (and we still have a not-null probability to interfer with a site having the same AK :P)

Debugging should be aside the normal behavior, not something changing it ... it's not quantum mechanic, I'd  like to study my application without interfere, not so much at least ;)

It's about accessability. And there are also developers that need accessability.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Tobion I agree .. but having tab to jump here and there without much control is not so accessible too .. so I think the right approach should be to introduce an access key to show/hide the dev bar.

@drAlberT An access key looks like a good idea.

@drAlberT Can you finish this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by drAlberT at 2015-08-03T08:25:44Z

What about [D] ..  (Debug) ?  it's not in the already taken standard AC http://www.standardaccesskeys.com/SAK2014/

Fine by me. ping @symfony/deciders

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I leaved the tabindex -1 in order to not interfere and added accesskey="D" in order to keep TB accessible

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just to make sure: Can I now navigate to the toolbar using the tab key or what am I supposed to use now when I don't want to use the mouse?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by drAlberT at 2015-09-09T15:55:09Z

Access key "D" will toggle the bar, then tab should follow the natural order
