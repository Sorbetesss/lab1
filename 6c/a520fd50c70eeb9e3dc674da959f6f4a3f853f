I have used `~1.8` as the constraint for now, is that correct, or should i use `^1.8`?  I see both  being used.

Bear in mind that since Symfony 3.3, there is only single place in Serializer left which uses ctype_ function  https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/f6760d38996f5fbd3904285f345b22a74748b279/src/Symfony/Component/Serializer/Encoder/XmlEncoder.php#L371

I have removed second use in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21676

@BackEndTea could you please make all changes in one single PR (this one as it has an important comment from @ostrolucky)? This would ease our work and would prevent almsot duplicate lines in the changelog. Thanks.

Will do, wasn't sure what the best course of action was.

I'll close the other PR's and update this one

In 3.4 the `Inflector` component and the  `WebServerBundle` use `cytpe` functions, while the `PropertyAccess` component no longer uses `ctype. This stays the same for 4.0 & master.
