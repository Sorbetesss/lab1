This needs some tests, at least a unit one for the factory, at best a functional one.

@chalasr others LDAP SecurityListenerFactory are not tested, it's a bit difficult and it's just an improvement of existing behavior. (json + ldap)

@ronfroy that's too bad but still, new code should be tested, at least ensuring that the container can compile with your addition in order to prevent regressions. That should not be hard, adding a `json_login_ldap` listener to https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/Tests/DependencyInjection/Fixtures/yml/container1.yml (and xml + php) and updating the expected config in the corresponding tests that will fail should be enough.
