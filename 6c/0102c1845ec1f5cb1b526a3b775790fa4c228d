I'm not fond of creation a special case in the option resolver component like this.

Maybe we could instead create a new `Validation::createValidCallable` (or another name) method that returns a boolean instead of throwing which could be useful for more cases that just passing it to the option resolver

I tend to agree with @jvasseur here. That sounds like a better approach

I agree, I'll update the PR later today.

@javiereguiluz I would expect a function named `isValid` to directly do the validation and return a `bool` instead of creating a `callable`.

@jvasseur you are right! I mixed things up ... as usually happens to me with the validator. Sorry! I deleted the original comment.
