What are the BC breaks here ?

@stof the type hints on the listener methods and the parent class of the TextUI classes - which all switch to namespaces when phpunit 6 is used

Well, the typehints are OK IMO. People are not expected to extend these classes, and the calling code is PHPUnit itself. And the signature comes from PHPUnit anyway.
As long as there is no BC break for people registering the listener in their phpunit.xml config, this is fine with me.

Same to me, that's what is done here :)
