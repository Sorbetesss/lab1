Should this emit a notice or warning if used in production?

It seems like a development pattern, and can be switched out for the extended class. Once the suggestion is implemented it seems like switching to the standard class might be more helpful.

@Lewiscowles1986 good idea, we could use the new class only in debug mode. Could be done in `ExtensionPass` based on the `kernel.debug` parameter. I'd also suggest marking the class `@internal`.

We don't even need to do it in a compiler pass. The debug parameter can be accessed in the DI extension (the `kernel.*` params can be accessed there safely, as they are set early)
