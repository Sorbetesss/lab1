This should not cause a single BC break afaik

You are correct. Technically this is not a BC break. But **strictly** speaking one could believe the intention was `\InvalidArgumentException` instead of `Symfony\Component\Translation\Exception\InvalidArgumentException`

Should we apply this on the lowest supported branch where it goes ?

I think so. But it is your call. That is why I wrote "master"

I think this is more of an "improvement" than a feature or bugfix. Sadly there's no mention of this in the symfony docs/semver. However, I do think it falls under the following:

> Coding standard and refactoring: Coding standard fixes or code refactoring are not recommended but can be accepted for **consistency with the existing code base**, if they are not too invasive, and if merging them on master would not lead to complex branch merging

< 3.2 actually throws `\InvalidArgumentException`

So for 2.7 you need to update the actual throws as well (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.7/src/Symfony/Component/Translation/Translator.php#L463)

Otherwise this could be 3.2 without any BC issue (it's a doc fix, at least for the current implementations ^^).
