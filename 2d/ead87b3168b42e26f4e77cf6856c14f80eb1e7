Does it also workaround for https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=60120 ?

@Koc yes, but as I previously mentioned : this workaround may produce corrupted output/error output in some race conditions.

For the record, I did not add a workaround in this PR, it already existed. I just fixed the tests and decouples the file handling in a sub class.
