And I agree with @Koc, this has potential to break lots of tests if I don't miss anything. We could deprecate this in 4.4 though and throw in 5.0 then.

By the way, our test suite contains an example of a valid test that would fail with this change (see the failing CI jobs).

PR rebase with 4.4, tests fixed and deprecation added.
