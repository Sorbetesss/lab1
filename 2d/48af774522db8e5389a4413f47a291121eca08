What does this fix? What type is the id value that you want to cast?

Well, does that even matter? It's a regression right?
But for info, https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-doctrine

Just because the new version doesn't behave exactly like the deprecated one doesn't mean it's a regression.

Btw, for your use-case the string case is not safe to use anyway, because the https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/blob/master/src/UuidInterface.php does not mandate a `__toString` method.

If you don't want to classify it as a regression, fine, although the feels like a stretch in this particular case.

My change is making the behaviour consistent throughout the class. It's casted to string in one place but not a other.

My particular use case has no relevance in the discussion.

Thoughts @webmozart? Since you wrote it.

Well it is used as a key in an array and ID in doctrine can be a value object.

I think it's fine to make this change. Could you add a test case though?

@webmozart thanks, will do
