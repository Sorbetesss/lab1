Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "7.1".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Is there a way to cover this case with tests?

This case was already covered with tests, but tests were wrong as well (see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/58371/files#diff-9c2d5e331a5ea6faf2c82cd0cbccf084d3b38ad9d640a8c0f88dc1ab0975ededL289)

Ah yes, I didn't see that the line came from a test. Nice üëç
