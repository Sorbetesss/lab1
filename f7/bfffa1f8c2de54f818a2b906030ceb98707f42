Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.3" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.3 for features / 5.4 or 6.2 for bug fixes".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

The fabbot seems to return a false positive currently:

If I see it correctly all failing tests are related to current 6.4 branch and not the pull request. So I hope I tackled all parts.

@wouterj thx for the review, I hope I didn't miss something but it should be all tackled.
