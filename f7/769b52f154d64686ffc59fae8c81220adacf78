Possibly my fault; I guess #5950 could/should have adjusted all of the decorators, instead of only APC.

Might be worth to make it fully consistent with https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/d231b8f16e5789f7b9f8554df05b90bb957b0bc0 ?

Yes, I was wondering about the different variable names. I think `decorated` does make a tad more sense, but I don't feel strongly.

Seems like a random failure or something strange. Tests pass locally and all of the fails there aren't related to ClassLoader. Can someone trigger a re-run? Or am I missing something?

@tstoeckler This PR looks good. Can you just fix the three small comments before we can merge?

I think that covers everything mentioned thus far.

Ahh yes, good catch! I changed that to keep consistency between the two classes, but you are of course correct. Sorry.
