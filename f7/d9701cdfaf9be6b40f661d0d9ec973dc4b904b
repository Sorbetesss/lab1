AppVeyor build has an error in code not modified by this PR:
```
1) Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Tests\Functional\SessionTest::testTwoClients with data set #0 ('config.yml', true)
RuntimeException: OUTPUT:  ERROR OUTPUT:
```
Must be a transient failure, since https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fabpot/symfony/build/1.0.32162 passed.

Reverted the mistaken style patch.

:-1:

I'd rather revert the problematic patch (#24987) and see if we can fix that problem properly, or live with the limitation.

I think I agree with @jakzal. I'm going to revert #24987

@fabpot Thanks for backing out the previous commits. That will help considerably.

Note that this PR also fixes a bug in getParameterOption that has existed for a long time. Would you like that re-submitted as a separate PR, or would you prefer to live with the limitation?

@greg-1-anderson Can you rebase on current 2.7?

Rebased. The only remaining failure is the mistaken code style change suggested by fabbot, as mentioned above.
