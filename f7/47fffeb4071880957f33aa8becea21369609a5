Thank you @HeahDude, especially for your inputs about what it could be nice to see. I let you know when I made changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@HeahDude I did the changes and updated the description accordingly.
Hope I didn't forget anything.

This PR and the base one are good to merge (or close).

Updated after #19614

I made the changes for using `profiler_dump()` properly and updated the description accordingly.

@fabpot I think this one is ready

This one would be great, because it also would allow to add a "user logout link" to the profiler. Before this PR the required firewall wasn't available. Also see #17037 for a poc.

Imho Security is the most complex thing for beginners. The fact we don't provide informations about it (i.e. the current firewall and all the logic behind it) involves that any security issue requires to look deeper in the core, which leads to misunderstandings and lots of support issues (just answered [one](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle/issues/263#issuecomment-257547939) by saying to the user to change the order on which firewalls are defined, it would have been easy to debug with this in the profiler).

The lack of feedbacks is too bad here. Shall I close this?

@chalasr please don't close it! You are right about the poor contents of the security profiler panel and debug toolbar.

Can you rebase now that the related PR is merged?
