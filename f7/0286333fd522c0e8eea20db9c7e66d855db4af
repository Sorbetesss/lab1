Wouldn't it make sense to check if we could make the type work with the `mapped` option set to `false`?

You mean ignoring the option or config setting? It could if we target master with a new feature as the mapping is a requirement for the transformer to do the proper validation. I think that trying to do otherwise will lead to adding unnecessary complexity. Unless you see a simple way to do it?

What about something like #36430?
