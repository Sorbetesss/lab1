Tests don't appreciate at all this change, see appveyor and travis... :)

Note: I don't understand something. PHP seems inconsistent:

* the parameter of  `locale_parse` should follow the [FCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) RFC. but I can also be an ISO_3166-1
* the return of `locale_compose` seems the [ISO_3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes).

**edit**:

Anyway, with this patch, my issue issue is solved in both case (with or without the int function)
