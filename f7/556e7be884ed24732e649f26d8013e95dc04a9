Syfony 4.4 receives only bug fixes and your change ain't one. What's more, removing a required parameter on public method in a non-final class is a BC break.

@javaDeveloperKid The PR removes an unused method argument and when I look into that file (RouterListener), I see that it implements the `EventSubscriberInterface` and this interface does not require the modified method to have this argument.

So how is that a BR break?

(Sorry for potentially polluting this PR, I'm just trying to understand things about Symfony better for my future contributions.)

If a class extends it, that child class would be broken because of the method signature mismatch. See https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html.
**But** this class is marked as `@final since Symfony 4.3` so it is considered as really final since v5, thus this change is fine from a BC pov as of v5.
Finally, as this change does not fix a bug, it should target 6.2.
