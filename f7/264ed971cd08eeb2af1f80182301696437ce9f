I don't understand the failure...

> Note that we need to keep the false string option was it's the only way we can have the XML working I reckon.

I don't why that should be the case? Isn't the xml loader also type casting certain values like "false"?

@Tobion is right, `false` should be auto-converted automatically for the XML format.

Even without `xsd:boolean`? Thatâ€™s interesting... ðŸ¤”Keep in mind that this comes from [this very non-strict `options`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Resources/config/schema/symfony-1.0.xsd#L385).

Anyway, this value also comes via the DSN so we need to handle the `false` string (I'm not sure there is any point to do some processing of `false`/`true` strings on the parsed DSN for now as it's our only use-case here).

@davidbarratt the Travis failure is unrelated. I've restarted the job, this should be back to green.
