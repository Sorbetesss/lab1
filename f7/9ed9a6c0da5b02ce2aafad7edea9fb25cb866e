That's a new feature, so 6.2.

Well, to me, that's a bugfix of the completion of option names

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree it's a bugfix.

No, it's not. Even the description is clear about that: "Add negation of [negatable options](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-5-3-negatable-command-options)". Adding something is not a bug fix (or at least, not anymore).

Well, the same description could be written as "ensure that all option names are completable for negatable options"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yea, I thought the same when reading the description. My reasoning is that completion should seamlessly handle any kind of option, otherwise it's buggy.

Shell completion is a form of documentation of the available options. Not suggesting the negative form `--no-ansi` is a defect that leads to a failure to understand for users of CLI tools. It would be a shame to have this bug once Composer enable completion.

I think the tester should be fixed also.
