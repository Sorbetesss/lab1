regarding if/elseif, I just implemented it the same way the other strategies are implemented ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüòä let me know if I should change it.

Sorry I don't understand what you're referring to with the `composer.json` and security-core?

only AccessDecisionManager does it this way, and honeslty the switch looks less readable than some early return statements to me...

On branch 3.4 then, as all CS changes (to reduce future merge conflicts).
And only if you're up to (not doing it is fine too :) )

@aschempp Can you add an entry to security and security-bundle CHANGELOG files?

Updated in 0c782393471c06556f7c2afd524a2a10a720de87. Let me know if that makes sense, I never did CHANGELOG files before üôÉ
