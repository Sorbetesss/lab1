Although I agree that this change makes sense (for the reasons explained by @Toflar), I'm wondering whether we should change the behavior of `Cache-Control: public` in a patch release of the LTS version or whether we should include such behavior change only in the next minor version (i.e. 5.4).

what do you think @fabpot @nicolas-grekas ?

@stof Yes, I've thought about this as well. I came to the conclusion that it is a real bug fix (and thus against 4.4), since it may lead to responses being kept in caches longer than you wanted.

I "found" this only yesterday when a customer reported they made changes somewhere but those did not show up for the end users: The old version was kept in the CDN although it should not have been.

But that's my 2e-2 ðŸ’°, you decide :-).
