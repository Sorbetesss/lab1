@lepiaf The 3.4 branch has been created and is the one that this PR should target (changing the based branch and rebase).

You should also rebase instead of merging.

This makes tests fail for now.

@lepiaf Would you mind rebasing so we can look if tests are still failing (fixing them if needed)? Otherwise I can take this over so we can close #21284
