Can you please rebase? This conflicts after #46454
Please also double check that the issue fixed in #46454 didn't happen here just in case.

Hello @nicolas-grekas , many many many thanks for working on this one!
Is there a plan to release the new feature within the month or so?
It would be great to know!

@kvailas See https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/releases.html for more information about our release process.
If this PR is merged in the next couple of months, it will be part of 6.2.

@fabpot actually i am using the expression language library as part of a **non-symfony** based project. Just loading the library in order to use the expression language from its respective repo.

Thanks for your input, appreciated.

@kvailas this does not change *when* the releases of the components happen (btw, Symfony-based projects also download components from the subtree-split repos)

Can you rebase on current 6.2?
