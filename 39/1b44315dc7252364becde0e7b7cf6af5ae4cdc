I like snapshot testing for the reasons you mentioned. We are supposed to update the generated code manually when a change is done? Adding an flag (env var) to force update would be very useful.

For reference, I use this library for snapshot testing: https://github.com/spatie/phpunit-snapshot-assertions

Not sure it worth a flag, but I added a commented snippet to help people generate code
