What I also found is that namespaces of interfaces and implementations are not consistent.
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Messenger/MiddlewareInterface.php is in the messener root. But the implementations are in a sub-namespace https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/master/src/Symfony/Component/Messenger/Middleware
But the implemtations of https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Messenger/HandlerLocatorInterface.php are also in the root.
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Messenger/Handler/MessageHandlerInterface.php is not in the root and the implementation neither.

So I'd propose
1. move the bus stuff to Symfony\Component\Messenger\Bus\
2. move handler locators to Symfony\Component\Messenger\Handler\Locator\
3. move Symfony\Component\Messenger\MiddlewareInterface to Symfony\Component\Messenger\Middleware\MiddlewareInterface

I agree with @Tobion . But I'd keep `MessageBus` and `MessageBusInterface` root as the main component entry point. It seems consistent with what we did with other components.

Good catch @Tobion, it was the right time to move them. I've moved the handler and middleware ones, kept the Bus one at the root like we do on other bundles like the Serializer.
