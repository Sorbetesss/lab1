@OskarStark Thanks for the review.
I am waiting for the opinion of a maintainer before proposing the changes in the doc to make it in one shot.

@chalasr could you please make the test more complex to simulate several inputs in a row? Thanks!

@javiereguiluz Of course, I added a failure test (3 questions for only 2 inputs) and made the first taking 3 questions for 3 inputs.

I also fixed the @OskarStark line notes and started to write documentation.

According to #17136, this will not work if the SymfonyStyle is used.
I'm working for find a clean solution (out of this PR), but making the SymfonyQuestionHelper out of the command HelperSet made interactive command testing very hard.
In a perfect world, the SymfonyQuestionHelper should be set in the helperSet and be accessible through `Command::getHelper('question')`. Actually the SymfonyStyle cannot access the Command and the Command cannot access the SymfonyStyle...

__EDIT__ Should be fixed by #18902

Doc [submitted](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/6623).

I made the changes and updated the doc.

@fabpot I made the changes related to your line notes.

Rebased this on #18999 to see the benefit by testing commands using both QuestionHelper and SymfonyQuestionHelper (via SymfonyStyle, no need of an HelperSet).
Would be closed otherwise.

@chalasr Now that #18999 is merged, can you rebase this one?

Just noticed that the second commit messages contain all messages from squashed commits, can you remove them as they are useless? Thanks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by chalasr at 2016-06-16T07:35:30Z

Made the changes, rebased and cleaned the commit message.

@fabpot As it takes the inputs as argument, I made the `getStream()` method static.
