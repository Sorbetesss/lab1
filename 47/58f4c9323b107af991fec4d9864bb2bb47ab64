Shouldn't the template be split into two (one for bug fixes, one for new features), as described [here](https://github.com/blog/2495-multiple-issue-and-pull-request-templates) ?

@Taluu most of the template is common. And when creating a PR using the github buttons, you always get the default PR template. Additional PR templates are used only when the URL contains a special query string (requiring to provide special links). I don't think we would benefit from the multiple templates here
