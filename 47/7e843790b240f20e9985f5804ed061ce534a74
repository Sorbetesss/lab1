> Here is a code review, but before fixing it: this will break configurations that target different arguments when the type is here or not. To them, the exception will be a false positive.

I guess it shouldn't break, because exception will trigger only if we have different argument type in binding and in constructor. But I also don‚Äôt like throwing an exception in this place I can suggest to add error message. It will look like this http://joxi.net/YmEyjBYtw5O7Bm
WDYT?
