We should not mix the listeners of various event dispatchers. That would make debugging much harder (as listeners from different dispatchers are totally separate lists).

If we can profile multiple dispatchers, the webprofiler panel must display them separately (see how the mailer panel handles a project with multiple mailers configured for instance).

@stof is that what you meant?

Yeah, it should look like that (and it means you won't ever mix the listeners from multiple TraceableEventDispatcher together and so you won't re-sort anything in the collector)
