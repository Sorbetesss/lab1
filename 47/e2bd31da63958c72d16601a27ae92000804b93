I've remove the deprecation of the `create` method and rolled back the changes in TwigBundle and HttpKernel for now, as @nicolas-grekas suggested. PR is ready.

All right, the change set should be minimal now. Still, my goal would be to remove the `create` method with Symfony 5, because it's redundant now.

The failure on Travis looks unrelated.

Anything left to do here?
