screenshot updated and JSON version included. I think the data set is pretty nice, and leaves us figuring out how to display processors/processed value in the text table without cluttering output too much. Still need to extract the actual prefixes though :)

text version conceptually ready :)

> Actually, do we need the json/xml descriptors?

not really, do you suggest to throw from any format other then text?

Throwing an exception sounds good to me.

aiming for

- `debug:container --env-vars` (shows name, default- and real value horizontally)
- `debug:container --env-vars APP_` (shows matching envs with prefix and processed value vertically)
- throw in markdown/xml, support text/json (having at least 1 machine format sounds reasonable and it's already there :))

@fabpot for 4.2? Do you suggest to keep the VarDumper dependency for now.. Form component already does it. Otherwise we need to squeeze #28898 as well

i dropped JSON support as well, no real need for a machine format to inspect/debug envs. They are bound to the current environment/runtime anyway.

@ro0NL Any chance to finish this one for 4.3? :)

@ro0NL What needs to be done before merging?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fabpot ready. Failures unrelated.
