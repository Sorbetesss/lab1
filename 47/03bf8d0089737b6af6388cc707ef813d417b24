I don't think this should be part of the DSN. That's an internal configuration setting, not related to the transport DSN itself.

Usage of a container parameter instead of a dsn option.

Can't this be solved from the outside, aka by providing a sendmail script wrapper instead?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes I guess it's possible but only if you have permissions to write your wrapper script on `/usr/local/sendmail`. This PR is mainly (at least in my mind ðŸ™‚) for configurations that you can't change (shared hosting...).

do you have this use case personally?

by l-vo at 2020-06-30T15:21:16Z

Yes, on an Ovh shared hosting with ssh (their former "pro" range) :/

@fabpot updated, logic for non-windows host a bit modified to reflect the removal of `native+sendmail`

Updated and CHANGELOG modified

@l-vo Great work as always, can you see if you can add some docs about this feature?
