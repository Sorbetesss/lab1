All inter-component dependencies should be updated as well, because currently, each component at 3.0.x dev says it requires 2.x versions of its dependencies (it may be fine to allow both 2.x and 3.x when both work, but it should allow 3.x at least)

@Tobion 2.99.99 versions are for doctrine/common that in turn has `~2.x` requirements. Without this we can't make composer happy. Some of them could be removed after merging #13135. The remaining will need a patch on doctrine.

As a side but important note, I do not expect these requirements, nor those in #13135, to be the definitive ones when `.0` will be tagged on 2.7 and 3.0. It's just a step to make tests greens and allow moving forward with the eyes wide opened.
