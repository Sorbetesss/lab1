Hey!

I think @ruudk has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

This might miss some pieces as I think some regexps like this one might prevent using FQCN in `%env()%` parameters:

Please update the description of the PR to make it clear what you're proposing. I could guess by looking at the tests, but providing a proper PR description is nonetheless a good thing to help ppl understand what this is about, and start the doc later on.

A next step could be to find a way to make autowiring do its part, so that the `enum:` prefix wouldn't be needed.
But that's for another PR :)

Can you please rebase on latest 6.2? We don't merge PRs with merge commits. If you want to squash while doing so, please do (we'll do it when merging otherwise.)

Rebase and squash is done!
