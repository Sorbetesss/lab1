@nicolas-grekas I can't reproduce the error in Framework Bundle (Travis pipeline), tests are OK when I run them. Any idea ?

LGTM.
Can you just add a test with the same method being defined manually AND via instanceof?
(it should be called twice: first by the instanceof, 2nd by the manual definition, isn't it?)
