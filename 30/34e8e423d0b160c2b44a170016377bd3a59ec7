All branches are impacted so I'll fix them one by one after each one is ok and merged up?

I think we should drop this change when merging up. All deprecations have been resolved in 6.0, so we need to re-evaluate this topic on 6.2 anyway.

I agree, I already prepared all PRs and it's easier to just drop the changes when merging up since each maintained branch is a little different :sweat_smile:
