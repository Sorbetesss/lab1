@derrabus indeed! Wasn't sure which tests to add though. But I'll definitely try to find some! ðŸ˜„

Well, you should be able to come up with a test that fails on 5.4 and passes after your changes. After all, you're fixing a problem here. ðŸ˜Ž

Oh yeah of course you're right! Just added them. If you see anything else, please tell me!

Speaking of that, should this be rebased to 5.3 as a bug fix or is it considered as a feature and 5.4 is fine?
