Damn, didn't find that PR before opening this one @ro0NL! Sorry for the duplicated MR!
So I guess the only way to use a `resource` with `Filesystem::dumpFile()` is to copy its code somewhere else :(

Should we reconsider since this works? If we really want a string, we should maybe throw a deprecation? That will force us to consider which alternative we should provide to ppl hit by the notice (and maybe make use realize it's simpler to just accept what already works?)

(could you rebase on latest 2.8 please to get rid of the CS fixes?)

@nicolas-grekas Rebased, cleaned-up and pushed

Note in 3.4 there's also `appendToFile()` which should be updated as well IMHO

I'm ðŸ‘Ž on this change for the reasons expressed in the linked PR.

I reverted the docblock change but kept the test case so that we don't accidentally break BC.
Removing support for array|resource would need a deprecation layer.
