With this PR, if someone runs the following command what would happen, exceptions would not be thrown if some directory is missing ?

```
APP_ENV=prod sf asset-map:compile
```

@smnandre I've attached 2 screenshots of what happens when the `APP_ENV=prod symfony console asset-map:compile` command is ran.

__If the `assets/` directory is in place, then this is the output (as expected)__:

<img width="496" alt="APP_ENV=prod symfony console asset-map:compile being ran with an assets/ directory" src="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/assets/8751750/af243b0b-97ec-4b1a-ac0b-db7a184f2742">

__If the `assets/` directory is missing, then this is the output__:

<img width="1348" alt="APP_ENV=prod symfony console asset-map:compile being ran with no assets/ directory" src="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/assets/8751750/caa746fa-a84b-4d53-85d1-94da87dbf32e">

So during the deployment/asset compilation process people will still be notified if the `assets/` directory is missing :)
