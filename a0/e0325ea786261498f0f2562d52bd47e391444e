In what way? It's fixing a regression in 3.2.0.

It's not supported today, so that's a new feature.

Strange perspective, not throwing a TypeError on valid input is a feature?

But then, everything is a bug fix.
Anyway, we favor stability over everything else in our maintained branches, so we're very strict in what we consider a bug.

I don't understand the point you're trying to make, there's a great scope between fixing a thrown `Error` and adding new functionality. Nonetheless, this should have little to no backwards compatibility impact; if your code was working beforehand, it'll still work now.

But it was at some point ðŸ¤” I don't know how Symfony handles regressions though ([Wikipedia says regressions are bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression)).

Symfony 3.2 EOLed was 5 years ago. Nobody reported this since then. So, that's a new feature.
As I said, we have a very strict definition of what is considered a new feature vs a bug.
