+1 to merge this fix asap (which could be seen as a security issue)

Ping @stof for the review (I don't know who's the best member from the [core team](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/core_team.html) in charge of the security component)

I don't think this could be seen as a [security issue](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/security.html) (wellâ€¦ sort of), but it's could be quite critical in some case and the PR stands for a few month now.

Thanks.

I think its a pretty severe security issue. If a user gets disabled he can still login with the remember-me cookie. If such a user is an admin (and there were certain reasons to disable the account), he can wreak havoc on the system...

Looks good to me.
