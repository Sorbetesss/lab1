@mbabker I force-pushed [these changes](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/5fb87138ca5339f94eabcee7917af6e2c9023ab8..fe420942d46fee11dd20b514270f9d0965465502) on your fork, can you please have a look and let me know if that makes sense?

Is that something that can be tested?

Looks right to me.

> Is that something that can be tested?

Maybe?  I'd have to sit down and work out testing the `AbstractDoctrineExtension` class in general.  Right now, I think more of this extension is being tested in the bundles than here.

Edit: I got PhpStorm to run the bridge tests with coverage to see if there was something existing I could add to, `loadMappingInformation()` has zero coverage right now

I guess this is tested in DoctrineBundle?

It would have to be since `loadMappingInformation()` gets called when configuring an entity manager.

Can you please send a PR to DoctrineBundle to add the new arguments there?

Sure thing!

Not sure what "newer bundle directory structure" refers to.
Current docs seem unchanged for many years: https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles.html

To answer my own question: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/32845

See also https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/16109, doc has some inconsistencies that should be fixed.
