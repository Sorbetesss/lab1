I'd prefer doing that in ResolveInstanceofConditionalsPass. Doable?

I'll need some direction for where to do this in `ResolveInstanceofConditionalsPass`. I tried a few different places but no luck.

just after `$definition->setParent($parent);`?

The definition is still synthetic at this point - this is being copied when converting to `ChildDefinition`. It's not being _copied back_ in `ResolveChildDefinitionsPass`.
