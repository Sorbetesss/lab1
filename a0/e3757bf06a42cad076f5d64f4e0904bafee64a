As this is a bug fix, 2.3 is the correct branch. Instead of creating a test file just for this bug, I would include the test in the current ones.

Moved the test into the other test case and changed the name a bit.

@fabpot should be ready now.

a testcase for "double" is missing?

@timglabisch well it tests that it uses the alias map, not sure we need one for **every** entry in the alias map.

@henrikbjorn adding such a testcase would prevent me from createing a pull request that removes the double entry. your choice :)

Can't the pb be fixed at the error message level? I fear adding this might just add confusion.

:+1: for error message level

As far as I understand the issue it's not about a badly worded error message, but it's a feature that doesn't work at the moment.

You define your option to be of type `boolean `. But when you then turn in the type check, the component fails to validate the value since there is no `is_boolean()` method, but only the `is_book()` method does exist.

This is not a bug fix but a new feature.

In the original issue #12586 I proposed 3 solutions, that's why it wasn't me making a PR. :) But yea, making aliases sounds like a new feature

:+1: for this. PHP has these aliases when casting, so it makes sense to support them when validating the type.
