@dosten can you give a use case for prioritizing service's decorator ? I fail to understand :-)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@dupuchba controlling the order in which multiple decorators for the same service are applied. ``new Bar(new Foobar(new Foo)))`` and ``new Foobar(new Bar(new Foo)))`` can lead to a totally different behavior at runtime. And without that, the order in which decorators are applied is undetermined (deterministic but not controllable)

btw, the issue requesting the change explains it already

IMO this can be labeled as reviewed, right?

@dosten indeed. note that anyone can trigger the status change thanks to @carsonbot (the update of the doc to describe our goals with it is not yet ready unfortunately)

status: reviewed

@stof Yes, I know, but I feel unconfortable changing the status by myself.

@dosten ah yeah, being the PR author, this seems fair to let someone else change. We have plans to implement a restriction about that in the bot itself in the future. I missed the fact you are the author when I commented
