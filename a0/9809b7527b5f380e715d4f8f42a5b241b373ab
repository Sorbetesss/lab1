ControllerTrait deals with a service locator, services provided by a service locator do not need to be public (and should not).
I see no good reason for making the command bus public, container aware stuff make no sense anymore (really since 4.1).

hmm, ControllerTrait is used by the FrameworkBundle's `Controller` class...

It's time to deprecate `Controller` :)

In the meantime... this is still a bug to fix ðŸ™ƒ

What would be the consequence of removing `Controller` ? Would impacted controllers have to use `ControllerTrait` ?

ControllerTrait is internal. The consequence would be to ask people to use AbstractController instead.
