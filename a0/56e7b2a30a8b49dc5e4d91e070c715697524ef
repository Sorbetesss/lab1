Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "5.4".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

> shouldn't `generateAlpha3Codes` be updated to include them as well ?

I agree with @ro0NL, T codes are preferable, B are considered legacy.

I'll squash commits before merge.

> (please squash if you can yes)

One commit is related to update-data on MacOS (fix)
Second is actually about this ticket.

I hope it's okay (prefer more or less clean and separate history)

We always squash so that one PR=one commit. This is the same topic :)
