This is a BC break, you need to manually escape the % char

@dosten  How should this be a BC break? Kernel parameter `%` signs are resolved before. And all other `%` should be passed as is to the sprintf. In other case they cause Exception (see the bug attached)

i.e if we have path `/var/www/some%2Fproject/` (which is `'/var/www/' . urlencode('some/project')`) we will have the exception. Passign `%` as is should not be a BC break as sprintf expects only one `%s` template in the path.

The better fix is to only apply the `sprintf` to `/Resources/%s/translations` and not the kernel root dir. This way there is no need to encode anything.

@Tobion Yes, and this would have more clear logic with sprifntf.

Does this one looks better?
