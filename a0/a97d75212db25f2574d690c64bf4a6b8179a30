As I said, the real problem is the locator. And depending on how the locator is fixed, this fix here applies or does not apply. If the locator really works with mixed, then the `is_string` can be dropped completely.

So how do i continue? Should I create an issue to discuss the FileLocator?

Since the FileLocatorInterface has been recently changed to only "allow" strings, it'd be nice if this change could be implemented.
