I think we should also not register the `ObjectNormalizer` as a service in the FrameworkBundle when the PropertyAccess component is not installed. We did that in several other places.

@xabbuh if we do that, will not it be very hard to debug?

@dunglas otherwise impossible to use
```
composer create-project symfony/skeleton
composer req serializer
```

@xabbuh, after double checking `ObjectNormalizer` is the only generic normalizer registered. It has a low property: it is called only if no other normalizer is matching. I think it's better in term of DX to get this exception than a silent fail like "no normalizer if able to handle "Foo\Bar".
