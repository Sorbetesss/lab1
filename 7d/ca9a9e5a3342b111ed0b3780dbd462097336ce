@tmysik can you please help me verify with this that the terminal now remains interactive? thanks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by cordoval at 2015-04-03T04:54:40Z

I think the failure in tests is unrelated to this PR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@cordoval Will be glad to do that! However, could you please provide steps how can I get Symfony with the fix/change? Thanks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It should be simple, you need to add my fork git remote add cordoval git@github.com:cordoval/symfony.git
then checkout fix-netbeans-interactive-shell branch and you should be in there to test.

@cordoval I must be doing something wrong but not sure what :/ I get:

```
Fatal error: Call to undefined method Symfony\Component\ClassLoader\DebugUniversalClassLoader::useIncludePath() in /home/gapon/NetBeansProjects/symfony2nb/vendor/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/ClassLoader/DebugUniversalClassLoader.php on line 41
```

The command NetBeans runs is:

```
"/usr/bin/php" "/home/gapon/NetBeansProjects/symfony2nb/app/console" "--ansi" "list" "--xml"
```

Thanks.

beforehand you have to run composer and all

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tmysik at 2015-04-03T06:53:25Z

@cordoval Sorry, no idea what you mean exactly. What I did:

* created new Symfony project as stated on the download page (using ```symfony``` installer)
* replaced the Symfony sources by your checkout (in ```vendor``` directory)
* run Symfony command to list commands

The result is:

```
Fatal error: Class 'Symfony\Bundle\DebugBundle\DebugBundle' not found in /home/gapon/NetBeansProjects/s2nb/app/AppKernel.php on line 23
Done.
```

Thanks.

no, don't use the installer. Development wise i always prefer to clone a symfony-standard edition and checkout branch 2.7, and then run composer install --prefer-source, then go under vendor and cd symfony/symfony then add remotes and git remote update and then checkout my branch after adding the remote. Tedious work but it is what is contributing to any package so far.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tmysik at 2015-04-03T07:53:14Z

@cordoval I followed your steps but still got:

```
Fatal error: Class 'Symfony\Bundle\DebugBundle\DebugBundle' not found in /home/gapon/NetBeansProjects/symfony-standard/app/AppKernel.php on line 23
```

Just for verification:

```
gapon@cattie ~/NetBeansProjects/symfony-standard/vendor/symfony/symfony $ git checkout fix-netbeans-interactive-shell
Branch fix-netbeans-interactive-shell set up to track remote branch fix-netbeans-interactive-shell from cordoval.
Switched to a new branch 'fix-netbeans-interactive-shell'
gapon@cattie ~/NetBeansProjects/symfony-standard/vendor/symfony/symfony $ git branch
  2.7
* fix-netbeans-interactive-shell
```

Thanks.

@tmysik the branch with the bugfix is based on symfony 2.3, not on 2.7. So use the 2.4 branch of symfony-standard too to test it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tmysik at 2015-04-03T08:11:22Z

@stof So, I switched symfony-standard to ```2.4``` branch. Went to ```vendor/symfony/symfony``` and switched again to ```fix-netbeans-interactive-shell``` branch. However, listing Symfony commands ends with this error:

```
[RuntimeException]
The console handler requires symfony/monolog-bridge 2.4+
```

Perhaps it would be great if someone could create a ZIP with properly configured symfony-standard project and proper Symfony version for NetBeans problem - I could it then just easily verify in NetBeans :)

Thanks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2015-04-03T08:28:16Z

I said 2.3, not 2.4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2015-04-03T08:28:43Z

ah actually, I mixed the version in my previous comment, sorry

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tmysik at 2015-04-03T08:34:05Z

@stof Perfect, thanks for the steps, it works now! And I can confirm that the Symfony commands are interactive again in NetBeans so everything works for us now. Thanks a lot, guys!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by cordoval at 2015-04-03T12:18:27Z

yeah sorry to have said 2.7, i really meant 2.3. Thanks @stof. @tmysik nice! great job!

This should be LGTM then :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by tmysik at 2015-04-03T12:20:04Z

Thanks a lot for solving this problem!
