I fail to see how the error can actually happen as this property is initialised inside the constructor.

I guess it can happen when the constructor is not called by a child class. Which child class are we talking about? Isn't this an issue with the child class?

I think the problem comes from old cache items, without null on the typed property it gets to uninitialized. Always hard to add types to serialised objects ðŸ˜… . We have no class in Shopware which extends that class
