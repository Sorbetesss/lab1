@nicolas-grekas , @Tobion , could you please give me some feedback so that I can move on?

@Tobion would you have time to help move this one forward soonish? Otherwise, I'd suggest to close (and keep the issue open)

I won't be able to work on this as other issues have more priority to me like #33065 and #32077

@nicolas-grekas , don't close the PR, please. I will have time to make it ready for review soon. At least we'll discuss it at the hack day in Lisbon ;)

@nicolas-grekas , ready for review with tests and deprecations!

I will finish the CHANGELOG and add the docs once you agree with the implementation.

For now I rebased onto master. Do we have any chance to get this in 4.4? Or it's too late?

@nicolas-grekas , fully ready for you review
