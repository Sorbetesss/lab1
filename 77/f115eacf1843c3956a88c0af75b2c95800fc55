I modified the changes from #12372 as [suggested by @stof](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/12372/files#r20435800).

However, there are much more calls to `version_compare()`. I think it does make sense to update them as well. What do you think?

@xabbuh Looks like a good idea to me.

Indeed, it is a good idea to change this everywhere

It's updated now. I hope I didn't mess anything up.

I was not sure how to replace something like this:

```php
version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '5.5.0-dev', '>=')
```

Is `PHP_VERSION_ID >= 50500` sufficient?

@xabbuh yes. Unreleased versions on 5.5.0 were already using the 50500 id (this id constant does not take pre-release versions into account)

Should be good now.
