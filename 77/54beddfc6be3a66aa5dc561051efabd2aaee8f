PS: Also not sure if this should be considered a bugfix and merged into 5.2.x instead of 5.x

Thinking a bit more about this, there might still be an issue when using JSON payloads: the `InputBag::get()` returns only `string|null`. That means booleans, integers, floats found in JSONs will be lost.

@nicolas-grekas that's only because of the phpdoc typehint, there's nothing preventing an `int|bool|float` from being returned. Maybe the typehint of InputBag should be `string|int|bool|float|null`?

Can you update the type hints so that we can discuss the full change that would be needed?

(and add related tests btw)

Added the missing scalar type hints and some testing
