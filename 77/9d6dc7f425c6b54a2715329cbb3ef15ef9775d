:+1: this complex system is not necessary anymore now that we deprecated the find-based adapters.

@fabpot is it possible to add tests for the regex detection here, including the case of all kinds of bracket delimiters ?
The logic was currently covered by tests of the Expression class, but we need to cover it by itself now as we won't call the Expression class anymore here.

and you need to mark tests of the ``Expression`` classes as legacy ones to avoid issues with deprecation warnings.

The tests where already in the iterator test class for `isRegex()`, but I've just added some more.
We should be good now.
