Hello @alexandre-daubois
Thank you for tackling this issue 👍
Are you still working on this PR?

If not (I totally understand), @stof @nicolas-grekas @xabbuh I suggest making `ConstraintValidatorTestCase` throw an exception when used with the `Compound` constraint with a link to this PR. Right now it is very misleading:
- A test may actually pass without any check
- A test may be false without reason

I lost about two hours yesterday because of that (not blaming anyone) 😬

Hi, thanks for the interest in this PR! I'd still love to see this happen in the framework. I'll rebase it on 6.4 :slightly_smiling_face:

I just rebased in 7.2, if anyone wants to have a look :slightly_smiling_face:
