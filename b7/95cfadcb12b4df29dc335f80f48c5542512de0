This also affects `If-None-Match` right?

Here's how the HttpCache handles this:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/HttpCache/HttpCache.php#L420

It does not tweak the `$_SERVER` vars but uses the `Request` API to remove the information after the `HTTP_*` values have been interpreted. This might catch other ways(TM) of sneaking in the problematic header values.

@ro0NL I think you're right and have added the removal of this header accordingly.
