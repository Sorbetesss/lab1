Small side note, the case where mine triggered, wasn't working with `requiresAtLeastOneElement()`, I've already tried that. I'll check tomorrow what it was used on (ping me in case I forget).

@iltar from your issue;

>  ->requiresAtLeastOneElement() is not applicable to concrete nodes

Im not actually sure this relates to the PR of mine :thinking: it should be _->cannotBeEmpty is not.._ then.  So curious about the breakage you experiencing :)

Still :+1: for this path.

@ro0NL No, that error is not related to the original issue, but your deprecation is saying `use requiresAtLeastOneElement() instead`, which will also error for me, so it might not be the right description

Updated deprecation message. @iltar OK for you?

I still find your issue confusing; the title refers to cannotBeEmpty(), yet the body mentions requiresAtLeastOneElement. Im assuming cannotBeEmpty() indeed raises this issue in 3.4

Yes, that message sounds good! üëç
