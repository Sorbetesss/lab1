php 7 doesn't agree with us, still failing :)

We could work around this failure by moving to a higher lowest version of Doctrine. Should we do it or wait for PHP to fix the issue?

After some investigation, the version bump is legitimate and related to a bc break in PHP7 (related to a new behavior of func_get_all()). Doctrine ORM 2.4.5 [fixes the issue](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/pull/1142) and is required on PHP7.
Status: needs review

the bump is not an issue IMO. Doctrine 2.2 and 2.3 are long EOLed
