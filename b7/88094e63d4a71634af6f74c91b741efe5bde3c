I don't know what the custom is as far as test coverage, but the test seems like overkill to me.

The other relevant classes, such as GetSetMethodNormalizer, don't include a test for the context parameter. If the test is added for XmlEncoder, it should probably be added consistently so other classes are tested as well. But, as stated above, I think this is overkill.

@benji07 Can you remove the test?

yes and done

oh, and I forgot to ask you to add a note in the component CHANGELOG file.

Where ? inside the 2.3 or the 2.2 version (the context was added in 2.2)

As this PR is going to be merged in master/2.4, it should be in the 2.4 section.

ok, I could change the base branch for this PR, and use 2.3 instead ?
