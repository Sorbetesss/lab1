I suggest adding some phpdoc on the ``register`` method describing the different accepted values for the mode

I actually like the weak-verbose mode. What's wrong with it? But as long as I just need to set a very high number to achieve the same, I'm fine with it.

@craue that's how you can get the equivalent of weak-verbose yes
