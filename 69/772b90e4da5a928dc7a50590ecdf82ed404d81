This is not true, actual version is correct.

Now you can see `$value < $this->min` and `$value > $this->max`, with your message it must be changed to: `$value <= $this->min` and `$value >= $this->max`.

@stloyd no. As the error is added for ``$value < $this->min``, it means that the valid values are ``$value >= $this->min``, i.e. greater than or equal
