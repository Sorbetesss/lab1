not needed IMO. You could just make it use form 2.8+ (as done anywhere else in our inter-component dependencies)

@stof What do you suggest to achieve that (the FrameworkBundle does not require the Form component)?

@xabbuh by adding a conflict rule

@nicolas-grekas that would work. But is the overhead that was added to the dependency resolution process justified just to avoid the condition here?

@symfony/deciders What do you think? Should we use the test as implemented in this pull request or add a conflict rule instead?
