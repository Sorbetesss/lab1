If this is accepted I think we should rely on the DebugClassLoader (see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Debug/DebugClassLoader.php#L283) instead of the constructor which isn't safe (it may be overriden).

I think it's ok to remove `@trigger_error` at all.

Why is this triggered? What does trigger it? What is specific to `Controller` that makes it special *vs* other classes that have the call?

I don't sure why it happens, but you can test it by yourself. If you will use `composer install --optimize-autoloader`, `var/cache/dev/srcApp_KernelDevDebugContainerDeprecations.log` will store this DEPRECATION. It's wrong behavior.

And if you using `Monolog`, it will print Deprecation in profiler, even if `Controller` is not used.
