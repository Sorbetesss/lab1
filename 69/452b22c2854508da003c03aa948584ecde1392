@nicolas-grekas can we have tests covering the dumping of lazy services to avoid such issues in the future ?

@stof not really - that would require adding the proxy-manager bridge as a dev-dependency of the DI component and add tests for it. Too much effort for too little benefit IMHO.

@nicolas-grekas or having such tests in the proxy-manager bridge

Not sure how to test this specific behavior from the bridge... The bridge is not part if it actually, it works the same with the different modes (5.0, as_file=0/1, etc) A true regression test would require testing the integration from the DI component.
