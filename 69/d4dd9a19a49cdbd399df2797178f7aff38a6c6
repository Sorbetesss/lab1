This must be documented in the component changelog for 2.6 (prefixed with ``[BC Break]`` and in the UDGRADE-2.6 file (as it is a BC break)

@stof I will do that once it is agreed that this can be merged. I have restricted it to a rebase of #11590 until there is agreement about exactly what to do.

I don't understand the reasoning: it cannot be merged without the changelog update requested

@stof As far as I understand, @tommygnr wanted to know whether or not the way he fixed the issue is approriate before investing more time in this (mainly because of the BC break I think).

Well, the discussion in the previous PR already indicate that we agreed abotu merging such change in master (the reason the PR was replaced is that we rejected changing this behavior in 2.4).
And the way to fix it is the only one (removing the check for ``null`` and empty strings).

IMO, the only thing missing to make it mergeable is precisely the changelog update

@xabbuh was on the money. Anyway, since I am now clear that the approach I took is acceptable I have added the required changelog entries. @stof let me know if you are happy with the wording of those entries.
