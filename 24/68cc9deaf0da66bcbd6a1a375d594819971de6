@derrabus I would love to. However, the original functionality doesn't have a test to begin with. Also, this test would necessarily need to refer to external files and I don't have any idea how to do that in your test suite. Can you give me a pointer how you would go about this?

Writing tests could be done by adding a directory with fixtures in a test folder.

Thanks for the suggestion, have made a new folder with an attribute annotation entity and added a test to detect the different kind of types.
