Caching is normally done with decoration, isn't it?

@bendavies maybe ;). I wanted to show that there is indeed a problem and a quickfix implementation.

Should have been fixed by https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/31452, no?

Not that I'm aware of. The cache added in the PR seems to be at property level. But for each property/method extraction you need to parse the original file. That's what i'm trying to avoid.

Just seen that it was in 4.3-rc1, so nope not fixed!

Great, thanks @lyrixx and @dunglas for the approvals.

The PR is based on 4.4 because I read somewhere that performance stuff should be a minor, not a patch version. Should I put it on 4.3?
