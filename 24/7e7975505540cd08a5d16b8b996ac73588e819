Can you cover this with an unit test?

Added phpunit tests
I have fixed code style and updated code with master + force push to my patch-1 branch

You need manually rerun build checks:

> If you have write access to the repo: On the build's detail screen, there is a button â†» with the tooltip "Restart Build".

Symfony 2.7+ So what to do now? It will be automatically merged into Symfony 3 too?

@insekticid That's correct. We are merging bug fixes in the lowest branch where the bug exist and then merge it back to all other branches (2.8, 3.2, and master right now). Can you change the target of the PR and rebase it? Thanks.

@fabpot PropertyInfo exists since Sf 2.8 so I remade patch-1 for remotes/origin/2.8

@insekticid You forgot to change the branch of the PR
