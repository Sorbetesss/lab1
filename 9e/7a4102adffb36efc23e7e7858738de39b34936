Hum, actually the message says `No PSR-17 response factory found. Install a package from this list: https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation.`
The one about `No HTTPlug clients found.` is from another dep that calls `Http\Discovery\HttpClientDiscovery::find()`.

This is a mess, sorry :)

Reopening, the message is still better.
