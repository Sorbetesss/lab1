Looking at the failing tests I just noticed I did not fix all cases yet. Before putting more efforts in, what do you think of the proposed solution @xabbuh?

@fancyweb up to move this forward?
@xabbuh any comment?

@fancyweb Isn't the test just failing because of the bug you are fixing here? I mean the test does not set the `html5` option and thus now the deprecation is properly triggered which wasn't the case before while it should have been.

@fancyweb Can you have a look at the last comment?

@xabbuh I finally took the time to look at this and you were right. I set the html5 option to false on the failing test.
