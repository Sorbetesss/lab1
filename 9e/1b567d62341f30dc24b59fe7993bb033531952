@hhamon I get it, yoda-ing it now :P

@hhamon I've corrected the non-yoda to yoda statement, I've also corrected the ones which I didn't change into yoda statements.

@stof I've corrected the case where only one method is present after filtering out the HEAD method.

Perhaps it would be good to rename `isGetLikeMethod` to `methodWhereHeadMatchesGet`? Might be a bit verbose, but in this case I think being explicit is preferable. WDYT @stof?

I've also added another test fixture which more clearly demonstrates the effect of the method optimisation.

Tests currently seem to be failing because master is broken.
