@lazyhammer updated code as per your suggestions.

@fabpot could you please review and possibly merge this into master and 2.2 branch?
This is a bugfix to make inline fragment renderer behaves the exact same way as Symfony handles requested from reverse proxies, such as Varnish. Also updated the tests to handle this concept.
