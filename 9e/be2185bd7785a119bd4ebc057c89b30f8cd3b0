@pquerner ive tested this with the RemoteCall plugin.. and results are impressive i must say. Good news is for SF this works out-of-the-box with

```
framework.ide: http://localhost:8091?message=%%f:%%l&/from/path/>/to/path/
```

AFAIK there's no real need for making this an XHR call (but i tested this only in chrome, which magically also preserves the current URL).

As a result im experimenting with integration in the toolbar.

Works perfect; thus super fast template navigation. Needs some CSS.

The Magento Module does it via XHR aswell, so there are no unneeded browser tabs.

Impressive work so far. On a page with loads of templates the select box are not very helpful I guess, since you cant "spot" the right template from it as quick as from the profiler template page. Maybe limit results in that select box or make it optional via configuration?

SF doesnt add `target` attribute, so works by default :) (with ctrl+click you indeed are left with empty tab). it's more the browser compat. im not sure about.

Access from the WDT is really worth it.. so i hope we can do something. Ideally has "select as you type".

Select as you type would mean you have a small idea on the templates filename. Which is not the case when working on a project you just took over for instance? I dont know. Hard to spec this out I guess.
Some of the big folks should look at this. ;)

Agree, it's experimental really. Also from a "navigate to used templates" pov, this saves a profiler visit. So again; if we can do _something_ that be awesome.

However the issue of many templates is real; so i can imagine we wont be able to integrate this properly in the toolbar.

Well, I just opened a page of my own project and looked at the number of templates listed in the profiler. There are 35 (I have a deeper inheritance hierarchy than just a single layout, and a bunch of helper templates being included for reusable parts). I don't think this would fit in the toolbar itself (and I actually rarely open files from the profiler btw, so a big selector would actually annoy me)
