Not really related to this PR, but I think that the Propel bridge should be removed from Symfony (3.0 or even 2.7?) and moved to the Propel organization. What do you think?

I agree the Propel bridge should be removed from Symfony 3.0 and managed by the Propel organization.

@fabpot @hhamon I'd move it in 2.7. We could probably do it in a BC manner, right?
