@fabpot please also merge to master, so I can make a PR to remove the deprecated stuff.

@Tobion there seems to be some remaining ones in the FrameworkBundle functional tests: https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/46636638#L1759

@stof Yes the reason for this was hard to spot. But I found it and fixed it in a BC way. The problem was the container parameter resolving in the framework router that still accessed the deprecated requirements.

I still think that my suggestion in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/13361#discussion_r22793424 is legitimate. What do you think @fabpot ?
