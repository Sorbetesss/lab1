I think this PR can be targeted against 2.8 since it's not a new feature.

@andrewnclark, looks like you have accidentally changed the base twice and now it's again 4.1 :)

All the additional commits scared me so I rolled it back. Is changing the base in this way the correct way to do it?

You should also rebase it in git so that the commit starts from the tip of the 2.8 branch.

@vudaltsov thank you, will fix merge conflicts from rebasing and push update in the morning.
