This one breaks tests and should be done in master as this is a new feature.

Agree on master. I improved some affected tests already in #20569, preferably that goes first :)

I think they are not really related and this one can probably be merged much faster than the other one :)

Fair enough :) it's not the effort anyways.. ill update tests this evening :+1:

Ready. Failing test (PHP7/redis) seems unrelated.

edit; apparently HHVM differs on the `DATE_COOKIE` constant :angry: ([ref](https://3v4l.org/K5BYL)) put back the original format hardcoded?

Truly ready :+1: (also no conflict with #20910)
