Hey!

I think @TimoBakx has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

The `DebugFirewallCommand` part looks good. üëç

@GromNaN these missing backslashes seem like an issue with the completion command escaping itself and input escaping. The suggestions provided by the `debug:form` do contain the backslashes so it must be something wrong with the terminal or the completion engine. Are there any similar issues in other commands too?

Same issue with backslashes in #43653.

I've proposed a (quite ugly) fix for the backslashes: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/43664 I welcome more testers of this script, as I'm not sure how well this actually works (it works on my machine‚Ñ¢)

LGTM. I used this PR to test https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/43665 and it worked very well.

Regarding class types, the short names could have been completed in case someone type "ButtonType" for example. But name conflicts can appear and the completion made the FQCN  lot easier to type.
