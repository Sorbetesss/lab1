I think this PR is ready but I'd like to have more feedback on the open discussions before addressing them.

Could you please send a PR that only fixes the infinite loop before this one is finished?
Tests on appveyor are failing since a month and it'd be great making them green asap.

See #43704. Test failures seem unrelated (this time). Sorry for the trouble :(

(don't forget to remove the draft status when you're ready)

What's the status of this PR? Is it ready to be merged?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I remember the test failure looked unrelated to changes here so yes, it is ready to be merged. I'm going to rebase it to make sure all tests pass.
