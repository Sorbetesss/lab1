@tgalopin only have a question about performances.
Nicolas said at SymfonyLive that for now doctrine is a little bit more performant than Symfony cache.
Is this PR intended to improve performance or/and to implement Cache component ?

@mickaelandrieu I also said that the difference in terms of performance was negligible and that we shouldn't care. In fact, PhpArrayAdapter is faster than Doctrine (for what it means :) ).
