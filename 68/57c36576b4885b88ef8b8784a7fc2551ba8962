3.0 is probably not the right target. It should be 2.3 or master/3.1. What do you think? It's not really a new feature, but might cause problem is people are relying on the simple `@Event` tag. So, I'd say that we need to merge this one in master/3.1. Is that ok?

i did a rebase on latest changes in 3.0 branch. `master/3.1` sounds good for more.
