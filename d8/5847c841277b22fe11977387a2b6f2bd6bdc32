I was able to test the behaviour with this [repository](https://github.com/monteiro/PR-41553-symfony). Feel fee to test it too. Everything seems to work fine, and the global failed transport is set correctly.

I tested using the AMQP transport in the [repository](https://github.com/monteiro/PR-41553-symfony).

Hey!

I think @DavidBadura has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!
