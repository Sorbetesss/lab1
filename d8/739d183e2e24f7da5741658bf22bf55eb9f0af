@staabm updated thanks.

Note that our test suite is pretty nice on this topic, coverage is pretty great. I also used this patch to compile Blackfire's container, and it produces exactly same output. Confidence is good on my side :)

Do we need upgrade notes here? This is mostly internal thing IMHO.
