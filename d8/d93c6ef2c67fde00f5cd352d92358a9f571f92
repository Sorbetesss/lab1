Oh, I like this so much. Can we leverage this, to be able to configuration the dumper? (may be in another PR). I would love to do something like

```
dd($value, max_depth: 4);
```
to automatically expand the 4 depth level

Big yes to me, @lyrixx! When talking about this idea, Nicolas seemed to have a few other ones that could definitely fit with this evolution in future PRs. A set of "reserved" named parameters to tweak `dump()` and `dd()` behaviours sounds great!

Names starting with `_` should be forbidden and reserved to the futur options.
