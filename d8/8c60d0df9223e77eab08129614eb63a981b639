won't a `&nbsp;` do it as well?

It sure could, but personally I think that it would be less understandable. This fix improves usability a bit, too, IMO.

@kix thanks for this PR! I personally love this kind of small fixes that improve the overall quality of the framework. This will lead to less confusion for developers and that's very important.

I also agree that showing some explicit message, such as `no name`, it's better than displaying a white space.

@webmozart Done. Is it better now?

Yes! :) Could you add the same fix to the details view on the right?

Got it. Right-side detail view is updated in the same manner, too.
