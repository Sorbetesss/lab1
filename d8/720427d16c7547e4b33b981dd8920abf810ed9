New comment looks good to me. @WouterJ Can you also update the 3.0 UPGRADE file to mention the availability of this service?

@fabpot I've added the removal (and its replacement) to the UPGRADE-3.0 file. I'm not sure if it's correct though (it's very difficult to follow the whole asset things with all its BC layers).

Can this please be merged? It's holding up CMF's tests to check if it is future compatible.
