Is it really useful to know the number of validator calls? How does it help?

It shows something went on if no violation occurred.

The number usually isn't much important right. Having only the icon might be enough actually:

<img width="870" alt="screenshot 2017-08-10 a 10 42 58" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2211145/29162113-baf0d212-7db8-11e7-984c-cc8c1bfcf182.PNG">

But all other items have values, which makes it a bit weird.

Displaying the number of violations when everything went fine means displaying `0` which is always a bit misleading on what happened at first sight. So, to me, in order to acknowledge validation calls were properly made as expected on a given request, either we should display the icon without associated value, either with the number of calls.

Despite the arguments above, I recognize this is highly subjective but was my feeling after using it a bit more and being used to the form toolbar item behavior.

The icon without a number looks confusing and out of place. I think that the proposed behavior is consistent with other panels (translation, logger, form, database):

* No errors and no calls: don't display the panel.
* Calls but no errors: show the num. of calls.
* Calls and errors: show the num. of errors.
