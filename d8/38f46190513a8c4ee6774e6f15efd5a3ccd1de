@nicolas-grekas I need to adapt tests don't I? The option needs to be set in alot of functional tests.

@nicolas-grekas is there a way to ignore this deprecation notice in Symfony tests when it's self triggered. otherwise I have to explicitly set the http_method_override: false in hundrets of test fixtures. kinda ugly and pointless.
There are 114 yml files alone. Then the likely the same amount in xml and php.

Nope there's none, and that's on purpose to me: eat our own dog food. We're asking ppl to opt-in, including ourselves.

Well, users will not be affected when using the recipes. And the people who are, only need to change 1 line. We have to adjust hundrets of unrelated tests.

I fixed the tests and adding changelog/upgrade. This is ready now.
