@HeahDude : Is it worth working again on this PR or should I wait your propositions about https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/20978#discussion_r92943106 ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I suggest to wait :).

Moving to 4.1. Rebase on master needed, where PHP 7.1 features can be used btw.

@HeahDude Any ways we can unblock this PR?

What about allowing the option to be a closure that would get passed the transformation failure exception and would return the error message to use?

@xabbuh : Would you remove the safe message in favor of more specific `TransformationFailedException` instances then? I'm fine with both solutions, but I thing the safe message approach is more convenient than creating a dedicated exception and treat it in each form type `invalid_message` option when relevant.

After thinking about it again I think having a message key in the exception isn't such a bad idea. It's also consistent with what we support in the Security component.

Woops. I've closed this one by mistake.

@ogizanagi @HeahDude I think we need to take a decision here. Finish/merge or close?
