@tcheymol what about Api transport with mailjet ? i was working on it before i saw your PR so perhaps i can help if you have not done already ?

@lwillems Yes, I started working on it, but I needed a first working version quite quick, so, I did not work on the Api part at first

@tcheymol Any plan to add support for the Mailjet API? Perhaps @lwillems can help you finish the PR?

@fabpot Yes, that is my plan indeed :)

@tcheymol Can you submit a PR on symfony/recipes (you can have a look at other notifier bridge recipes to get some inspiration)?

@fabpot You are right, I will look at the recipes, I will work on this this week

https://github.com/symfony/recipes/pull/809

By the way, how do you handle Packagist repositories creation ?

Not sure I understand the question, but the code is automatically extracted to its own repository which is then submitted to Packagist.

@tcheymol Can you fix the minor issues so that I can merge? Thank you.
