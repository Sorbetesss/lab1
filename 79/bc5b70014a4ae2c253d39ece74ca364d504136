Not a big fan of adding such an interface TBH. Your implementation extends the core one, right? In which case, type hinting with the class is not an issue.

My implementation does not extend the core one as the core one is declared final. We simply overwrite the TranslationExtension service using the core class and only passing a different NodeVisitor as second argument

As it stands we've already had to copy and modify a few core classes (TransNode for example) to make our implementation work, so to upgrade to symfony 5 we could do the same with TranslationExtension.

I will change the typehint to `TranslationNodeVisitor` and target master.

Looks like there is an unrelated commit in the PR. Can you get rid of it?
