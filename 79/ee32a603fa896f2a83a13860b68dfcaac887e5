Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Can I get some feedback on this feature?

@fabpot Thanks for the review. I changed the code according to your comments and added a test.

The CI failure seems unrelated.

Status: Needs review

@fabpot Updated. Is it okay to keep the promoted property or should I use the non-promoted syntax?

Tests are failing but once again I don't think it's related to my code.

I squashed everything into a single commit.

Also added a documentation PR.
