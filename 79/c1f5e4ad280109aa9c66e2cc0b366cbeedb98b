Thank you for the review. Yeah you might be correct. This could be considered a bugfix.

To me that's a bugfix.

@Nyholm Can you change the base branch to 2.7 (I think that should be considered as a bug fix).

Tried to do it on the phone and failed. Will fix this when I get to a computer.

Thank you for the reviews.

I wonder if we don't have to update any test fixtures.
