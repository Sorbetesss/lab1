Note that there are some values that currently works but that will throw now (and they should throw). For example:

- Empty `!` in an array --> `[!]` currently gives `['']`
- Empty `!` in an object --> `{foo: !}` currently gives a `TaggedValue` with empty tag and value
- `!` followed by (`]` or `}` or `,`) --> `!}` currently gives `}`
