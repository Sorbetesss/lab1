@fabpot @stof I have updated the code to make the type attribute case insensitive, do you see anywhere else I could fix it ?
@stof Any idea on how to test this modification?

@geoffrey-brier write some tests using an uppercase type attribute (i.e. exactly the case you faced)

@stof I just wrote a test

apparently, tests are broken (https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/builds/24294084).

@fabpot sounds like the `lower-case` function does not exists in XPath 1, I've tried another way of doing that.

Tests are broken but I don't think it comes from my modifications, could you confirm @fabpot ?
