I think I'd prefer making this part of an existing CI file. I don't like the multiplication of eg initialization steps. That'd be better for the planet... :) Doable?

About getting the modified packages, maybe it's not worth it? maintaining these is always costly on the long run.

` find src/ -mindepth 3 -maxdepth 3 -type d '!' -exec test -e "{}/LICENSE" ';' -print` minus the false positives?

Thank you for the feedback.

Instead of having one job per changed component +1 I now do all the checks in a single job. It means a bit more bash and we have to deal with json objects.

I do some grouping and I show clear errors what is wrong.

I think this job is a good idea. It's a common mistake to forget adding these files when contributing a new bridge package.

I removed the debug code. This PR is ready to be merged.
