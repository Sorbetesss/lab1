what is the motif @inalgnu ? raising the coverage of symfony? do these tests do that? also @WouterJ is right in a way, however tests also tell a story cc/ @briandoll :baby: , so maybe check if there are tests already that tell this story in the test suite ?

@cordoval yes, these tests aim to rise coverage.
