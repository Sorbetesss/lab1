This must be merged on 6.4 (because of the BC break, which is allowed in 6.4 for experimental components, but not for a patch release).

@fabpot Would you like to take over this, or if you had done work on this already, discard this MR as you probably have better knowledge in this :sweat_smile:

Actually, I like your code better, so if you take into account my few comments, I will be able to merge it fast.

Sorry I think I misunderstood your comment @fabpot and retargeted this to 6.4 :sweat_smile:

The triggers have changed quite much between the 6.3&6.4  branches, but I should still target 6.3 and leave conflict resolution to someone else?

Oh my, I think I have notified everyone... sorry guys!

I will finish for today not to cause any more trouble.
