I don't think introducing such lineLength setting in the public API just to fix tests make sense

@stof Yeah, it seemed a little odd to me too. So should I use reflection in the tests to access the private property or do you have something better in mind?

yeah, using Reflection to force the length might be an option.

Updated to use reflection instead.
