@ostrolucky the main problem is moving this line -> `var profilerCell = row.children[0];`  I did that because this cell is now the first one instead of the last one, so it was weird to leave it at the end as before. But I can revert this if needed ðŸ˜ƒ

Yes I see your reasoning. I would do the same in most codebases too.
