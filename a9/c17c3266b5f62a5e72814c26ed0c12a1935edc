ok .. will look into writing a test case, though I am not sure if this is testable on the CLI ..

i tried adding a unit test but as I feared it doesn't seem possible and it seems like we do not really have other tests for this either.

I looked a bit on the web and found:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9745080/test-php-headers-with-phpunit
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9127252/phpunit-test-for-expected-headers

but I could not get either of the proposes solutions in the various responses to work and return me all headers.

@lsmith77 you can add a functional test for php >= 5.4 (with the build-in php server).
