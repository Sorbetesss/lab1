What about renaming it to `MacAddress`?

For me `Mac` was cleaner, because the `Ip` constraint is not called `IpAddress` (consistency) & there are no different meanings of the word `mac`, so no conflicts

I see what you did there. 🍏

I actually find this name more relevant than simply putting `Mac`

Hahah, seems I'm so "anti Apple", that I forgot one of the most known names in world... :D

I don't think there will be any constraint used in real scenario to check mac devices (mac device names?) - but if, the constraint should be a prefixed with the name of the company, e.g. `AppleMac`. But I can change it to `MacAddress`, if preferred, just let me know :-)

As I said in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/51777#issuecomment-1742578118 I am not convinced that this is a common enough use case to be part of the Symfony core.

Yeah, maybe we should encourage releasing niche-y validators as standalone packages more.

Then again, we have other network-related constraints, like the already mentioned IP and CIDR. What makes this one different?

To me a `MacAddress` is general enough to be part of the core.

I vote for naming it `MacAddress`.

I can work with a client's IP address. But for MAC addresses I do only get the one from the latest hop.

@Ninos can you please elaborate on your use-case? Thanks

I vote `MacAddress` too

Renamed to `MacAddress`, hope it's fine now :-)

Application e.g. for storing device specific mac addresses

I still don’t see this as a common enough use case, but I won’t insist if others agree with adding this constraint.
