Let's target 6.1 please.

Can you please rebase onto 6.1? I think Psalm is confused by the 5.4 compat layer that should be gone on the 6.1 branch.

Okay, that didn't help. But nevermind, I think we can ignore the Psalm error as a false positive. Psalm apparently does not fully understand the stamps array and I think that's okay.

Yep, I think this is false positive.
