Thanks :)
Would you mind adding a test case please?

For which case? When tried to supply array callback? Because when array would be passed nothing will happen so I don't know what to test against.

For the case when you pass an invokable object.

@nicolas-grekas I don't know about Routing test I did not want to introduce copied test case so I just extended existing test case there.
