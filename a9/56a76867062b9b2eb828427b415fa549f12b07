Well-done @derrabus!

The question is: feature or bug-fix? It's a *safe* change: I mean, anyone with bad classes is currently getting an error... and this just makes it *not* an error. I vote bug fix - we'll see what other people think.

Agree on it being a bugfix. It doesn't introduce a new public-facing API, it just fixes incorrect behavior.

@nicolas-grekas, @stof: Do you agree with @weaverryan on turning this PR into a bugfix? I'd try to apply my patch against 3.4 then.

I do, go for 3.4 on my side

I've added some context to the error message extracted from the exception. Please have a look @weaverryan.

I've set up a `symfony/symfony-standard` clone with a class that extends a missing class. With Symfony 3.4 from composer, invoking the console fails as expected.

When I link the project to the code of this PR, the console is executed without failure. Now, if I add a public alias to the service discovered from my broken class, the console fails again.

The AppVeyor failure looks unrelated.
