I rechecked it on iOS mobile browsers. Works well. I mean only `type` without `inputmode`. I'm not sure that it is really a bug, that `inputmode` was added. Because `inputmode` attribute is still a part of HTML standard, it is not deprecated, it does not perform any negative side effects for form rendering.

Indeed itâ€™s not a bug, nor a feature. It basically added code for nothing so I believe it is okay to remove it.
