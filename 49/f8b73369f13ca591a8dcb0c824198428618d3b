Can you explain the use case for having priorities on extensions? I do understand the need for loaders, but I fail to see why we would need them for extensions.

@fabpot I was recently working on something and needed to overload a filter - I was lucky in that where I was registering it, it was after the previous one being registered (so as per docs here: https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/advanced.html#overloading) but figured that might not always be the case.

@ro0NL will add a changelog entry now, what version should it go under?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.0.0 but there's a 4.4.0 entry already, i think it's a typo :)

@ro0NL I'll add a 4.0.0 section, want me to correct the 4.4.0 one to 4.0.0?
