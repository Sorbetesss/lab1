> BTW maybe we should raise an error in cases like this?

nope we should not. the Yaml spec defines that the first element should be used in this case

Logging a warning could be useful

@stof  are you sure? [Yaml 1.2 spec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#mapping//) says the opposite

The 1.2 spec says that key must be unique. The 1.1 spec had an additional paragraph saying that even though keys must be unique, parsers should ignore subsequent keys

@stof well I actually feel like I shouldn't even care about it because it would be my mistake to have the same key in a mapping node, so I'm not gonna object. But I think it would be nice to have a notice in the UPGRADE file :)
