do we need the same for other non-bold styles ?

@stof that's already what the remaining of the default style does to me. I didn't notice any other issues.

So, only `default` needs to reset bold state, not `note` or stuff like that ?

It looks like so: there is always a default-styled character between any other style (even just a space).
At least I didn't catch any visual glitch related to another missing state reset.
