@yceruto I understand that the performance cost I discussed is minor. However your changes don't add any functionality and some would argue that you are just changing code for the sake of changing code.
Removing the dead code is useful, but I believe that there is no point in _fixing_ code that isn't broken to replace it with a version that is, even marginally, worse.

What do you think was wrong with the if/else statements ?
