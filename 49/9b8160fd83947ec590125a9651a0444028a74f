this will have to wait for 3.1. It is too late to incorporate such change in 2.8/3.0 IMO, given that the release is today

Would be helpful in case of silenced errors as I experienced them and it is not really a feature, just makes the errors more visible.

The question is just the target branch. As it is for me more like a bugfix it would be great to get this still into 2.8 to avoid confusion.

I agree with this PR. But I'd like to see two changes:

- ~~I would suggest to rename `Silenced Errors` with `Silenced Reports` (both in the toolbar and log panel).
The thing is that "errors" means it is a failure per se. But the silenced reports can also be warnings, info, notices, e.g. `@trigger_error('NOTICE', E_USER_NOTICE);` which is obviously not an error according according to the log levels.~~ Actually doesn't matter to me as you could also argue the other way that everything done via `trigger_error` are indeed errors.
- The actual level of the silenced report is not easily seeable in the silenced tab. Thus I would suggest to add it above the time in the time column. That basically just means converting `context.type` to the `E_...` constant names. So where the `Info & Errors` tab shows the Log Level, we show the `E_...` constant names for silenced reports.

If we do above changes, I'd also vote :+1: to merge it in 2.8 as it will prevent confusion due to these changes later.

@Tobion How would you convert the type back to the constant names? Any idea about that?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Debug/ErrorHandler.php#L49-L64 but with the constant names instead. Maybe the named constant should actually be added in the `context` directly. Then you do not need to do this in the view.

I have updated it to include an error_level in the context. This way we can keep the same renderer and I think this provides enough information. @Tobion what do you think?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2015-12-11T10:31:32Z

@Tobion Updated.

@javiereguiluz you agree with this PR as well?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2015-12-11T15:09:42Z

@Tobion sure! I love it. @peterrehm thanks for adding this feature.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Tobion at 2015-12-11T15:17:02Z

Ok to merge in 2.8 as a usability fix (and easier maintanance)? Or must wait for 3.1?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Tobion at 2015-12-11T19:28:48Z

Tests are failing

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by peterrehm at 2015-12-11T20:14:38Z

Should be fixed now.
