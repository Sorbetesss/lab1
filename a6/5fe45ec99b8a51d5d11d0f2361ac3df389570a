Is this the only class that would need an update?

By the way, according to our new [maintenance document](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/maintenance.html) we must do this change in the `master` branch:

> **Support for newer major versions of Composer dependencies**: Taking into account support for newer versions of an existing dependency is not acceptable.

@xabbuh I've made a new PR (master) for the other changes as they are only in the master.

This is not a major version though, this is a minor (5.1 vs 5.4), thus I think it should be merged upwards as it's a minor change anyway.
