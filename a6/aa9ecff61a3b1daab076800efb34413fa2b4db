Hi, what is the status PR? Do you think it could end up in 3.4?

@emodric I like this feature, can you implement the suggestions made by @stof?

@fabpot Sure, but how do you want me to handle it?

Open a new PR for deprecations only against 3.4 and target this one for master or did you have something else in mind?

You need to remove the argument and use `get_func_args()` to determine how it was called to handle the new arg and trigger a dep notice if needed. You can find quite a few examples in the code base doing exactly this.

Ah okay, I figured you wanted the feature to go in only in 4.0. I'll do it first thing tomorrow morning.

@fabpot I've updated the code to include requested deprecations. I updated the tests too in order not to trigger deprecation notices in them. There is a test failure in Twig bridge tests, but I don't see how it is related to this change.
