What about a generic trait that would call a private `doSetUp()` method?

You mean a single trait with all methods for the 3 classes?

yes, and keep the code in the current classes

Well, it makes sense.
But I'm not sure about the place where to put such unique trait, being the 3 classes spread in 2 components (Form and Validator)

:thinking: 3 proposals: one trait per component, add the trait in the bridge, add the trait in contracts. Pick one :)

Better now? Let me know, I'll squash

Looks like we're converging on something nice :)
