> Should `Connection::fromDsn()` set `Connection::$queueUrl` directly when it is given a queue url (to avoid calling `getQueueUrl()` on the SQS client when we already have it)?

Did not consider that to be part of the purpose of this PR. I rather keep this PR as minimal as possible.
The following DSN was already supported,
`sqs://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/ab1-MyQueue-A2BCDEF3GHI4`
this PR only extends that to support https DSN
`https://sqs.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/ab1-MyQueue-A2BCDEF3GHI4`

@starred-gijs for consistency reasons maybe  also this check https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6d4b26d25f3dcc224d7c66eb1e3bd1665c0bea21/src/Symfony/Component/Messenger/Transport/TransportFactory.php#L48
should be adjusted.
What do you think?

Wasn't sure how to update the changelog. Let me know if it needs to be different.
