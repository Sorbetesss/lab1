Yes, this is what I was referring to! This would reduce the amount of confusion and wtfs when working with the container.

Updated. But I was referring to the "main container builder" for those using the DI component standalone (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/24282#issuecomment-331399225), without HttpKernel (so no bundle). Not sure how we could turn this better, but only mentioning `Bundle::build` is not pretty accurate to me :/
