There is an issue here: you are handling retriesCount as a global variable. This is broken. Each Ajax loading through ``Sfjs.request`` (or ``Sfjs.load``) should have its own retrying count. Otherwise, it will simply not work when several ajax calls are done.

And for other elements loaded through Ajax, retyring may not always make sense. IMO, the ``maxTry`` should be an argument passed to ``request()`` (and you pass ``maxTry - 1`` when retrying), and the WDT toolbar loading should be passing the argument.
Retrying the loading of query explanations in the Doctrine panel does not make sense for instance.

@stof yeah you're right I will update it, but I did not know that something else were using the `Sfjs.request` or `Sfjs.load`, thanks for the tips
