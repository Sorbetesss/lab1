:+1: The YAML errors are indeed quite difficult to find.

The `ParseException` from the Yaml component allows to pass the affected line number and the snippet causing the error (failures will then be shown like `[...] at line x (near "foo").`). We should use that feature here.

Status: Needs work

But in Inline::parseScalar I do not have access to the line number. I find the line number not helpful as you do not even know the file, you anyway have to grep for it.

@xabbuh The ParseException already contains it in 3.0, as the parser does it with a global try/catch/rethrow

Okay, so good to go?
