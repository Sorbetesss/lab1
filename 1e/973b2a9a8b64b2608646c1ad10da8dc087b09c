Looks like a very specific use case but I think it does not hurt to support it. Can you submit a doc PR before merging?

I'm just preparing a PR for the docs. Will you merge this change to 2.4.x or 2.5?
I prepare it right now as if 2.5, because I think it was like "new features go to next minor version".

as this is a new feature it should land in master i believe, right?
