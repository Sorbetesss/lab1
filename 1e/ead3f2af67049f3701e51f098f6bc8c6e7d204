Thank you.

Im thinking of the label. Currently, if the label attribute is null, we are trying to create/invent a label looking at the ID. It feels weird that the behavior for `placeholder` and `title` is not the same.

But I also agree that we should translate null values, because that will cause an error =)

I am üëç  but I want to hear your thoughts on this ^^

Most of the time we can derive useful labels from the field names if it isn't configured. For placeholders and titles that not really possible. I mainly think that using `null` for both of them does not make much sense but I can also see the use case described in #37573 and I agree with the reasoning made there that we should not fail hard over it.
