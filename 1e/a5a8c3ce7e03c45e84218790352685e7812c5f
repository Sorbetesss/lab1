Can you please rebase onto 4.4 and push again, so the CI is triggered on the right branch?

@derrabus It's already based on the newest 4.4, I can't push it, because it's up to date

May I do the rebase for you?

Done. The Travis failure looks unrelated. We're having some troubles there at the moment.
