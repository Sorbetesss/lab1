Humm, not sure what triggered the broken test, seems like a Travis config bug as it says `The command "false" exited with 1.`

this is because we have ``|| false`` at the end of the parallel command (which actually does not make sense and should be removed). this means that the testsuite failed actually.
However, I indeed don't see the failure. This is weird

Console tests crashed with [a segmentation fault](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/28766594#L315).

@jakzal so that has nothing to do with the FrameworkBundle i'm guessing?

@rdohms it shouldn't. I'll restart the build and keep an eye on them.

Aaand it pased... looks like one of the accidental failures :(

Any word on merging this? @fapot?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides my small comments, that looks good to me.

@fabpot thanks, i'm on them

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by rdohms at 2014-07-25T09:18:45Z

Done. Should I rebase into a single commit?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

:+1:

You can squash the commits into one, but it's going to be done automatically anyway when merging.
