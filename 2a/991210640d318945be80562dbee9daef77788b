Is there any way to "feature detect" whether or not this option needs to be set (to `true`)?

@craue ``method_exists(AbstractType::class, 'getName')``, as this method has been removed in Symfony 3, and setting it is neccessary only in ``~2.7`` to get this behavior.

@stof, thanks. I wonder why `AbstractType::getName` isn't mentioned in the 3.0.0 changelog. But that's out of scope of this PR.

@craue because the changelog files are incomplete, as reported already. Latest removals have been forgotten
