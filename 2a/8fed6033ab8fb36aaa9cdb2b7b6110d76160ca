I love this proposal. Thanks @iltar for your work. I really can't think of any reason for not merging this.

Isnt this a BC break as the constants are now located a new place?

@henrikbjorn It's a BC break on the master branch only. They have been moved to that interface in my other PR. This change is currently not present in any tag.
