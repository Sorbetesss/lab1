Shouldn't this be opt-in, as it's technically a BC break for apps already passing a form as a variable?

I was thinking the same thing 👍

From the HTTP pov, this is a bug fix.

If I understand correctly, I'm not not able to pass a Form to my view (a FormView will always be passed instead). This is weird, I agree, I'm not sure anyone would have the usage of passing a Form instead of a FormView.

One possible issue: if exception is handled inside controller and status code is set to 500, this could overwrite it to 422. Not really sure which one should be correct in that case. (probably the 500)
Probably 422 status code can be set only if status === 200 (default one).

```
$response = new Response();
try {
  // do something
} catch(\Exception $ex) {
   $response->setStatus(500);
   $error = 'xxx';
}

return $this->render('template', ['form' => $form, 'error' => $error], $response);
```

And yes, I'm assuming no app is going to pass a FormInterface to twig, at least not as a root variable. I think this is safe.

Let's be on the safe side, the renderForm() method is back. PR and description updated.
