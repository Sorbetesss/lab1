wouldn't this cause issues to use a parameter for that ? Wouldn't any bundle be free to overwrite it ?

Well ok. But we always advertised autowiring as a bad idea for bundles before 3.3. I don't think this would be an issue.

I think this is important as we already got several reports by ppl being biten by autoregistration.
