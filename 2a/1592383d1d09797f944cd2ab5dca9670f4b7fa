Thanks for the help, @WouterJ. I think I've covered all of your points now.

:+1: looks good to me.
I've been recently asked how to use PSR-4 autoloading with this component, and I was surprised to see that it wasn't implemented yet. Thanks to this PR, this should be fixed soon :) .

@gnugat The reason why it was not a high priority for us is that approximately no Symfony project is using the ``ClassLoader`` from the component. They are using the autoloader generated by Composer, which is also compatible with the class loader wrappers defined in the component (``ApcClassLoader``, ``DebugClassLoader`` & co). So this means that these projects already have PSR-4 support.
