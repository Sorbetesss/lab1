is this convention sensible? should we support an explicit option? i.e.

```yaml
default_transport: some
````

Yes much better, doctrine or messenger are doing the same 👍

In which case this convention would be a problem? The sort does not matter except for the first one which is the default. Less configuration is better, right?

so the sorting matters :)

> Less configuration is better, right?

yes :) but im not sure we should ignore the configuration part in  "convention over configuration" otherwise it's just a magic convention.

I fail to see the magic here. The first one is the default one. That's all.

both work :) it's a doc issue eventually. To me the magic is, updating the ordering (i.e. to "alpha order") might change the default implicitly.

however, that's the case anyway as long as someone relies on the "first is default" convention, without knowing about `default_transport`.

Let's keep it simple then :+1:

note the messenger section does enforce 100% explicit configuration:

New (simpler/better?) implementation without BC breaks.
