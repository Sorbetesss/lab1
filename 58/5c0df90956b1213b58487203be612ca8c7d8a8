@pulzarraider If I am correct, this must now go into `4.4` branch, could you please switch the target branch for this PR?

I already did this for the corresponding Docs-PR https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/11647

@OskarStark That is correct, this is a new feature and the 4.3 branch is in feature freeze üëç

This looks like an interesting feature. I hope we can make a final effort to finish it before Symfony 4.4/5.0 "feature freeze" start in a few days. Thanks!

I will continue to work on this feature today.

I think this feature is finished. @nicolas-grekas @stof @sstok please review it again.
I hope it will be added in sf 4.4.
