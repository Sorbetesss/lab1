Why is the content already sent over the wire?

The occurred exception in this scenario won't lead to a non http-200 status which is a problem itself, no?

@staabm if the header are already sent with a 200 status code, there is simply no way to send a different status code (even without this change). This fix means you will see the error message instead of seeing the PHP warning about headers being sent

so should we log a message on warning/debug level which makes the dev aware of this issue...
already sent content is a error in itself, isn't it`?

@staabm This is done like this in [`Response::sendHeaders()`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.3/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Response.php#L269).

I'm not sure that we need a log for that. The developer need to focus on the actual problem, not on this resulting effect.
