Hey!

I think @remicollet has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Hi @Chi-teck, can you provide an example of "bash function", so that we can test your change?

@GromNaN It could be a simple wrapper around any Symfony app that already have completions dumped.

1. Dump completions for some existing application.
` /var/www/vendor/bin/some-app bash >> ~/.bash_completion`
2. Add the following Bash function to `~/.bashrc` file.
```bash
function some-app() {
  /var/www/vendor/bin/some-app
}
```
3. Log in and log out for the change to take effect.

Check if completions work for `/var/www/vendor/bin/some-app`  and for `some-app`.
