I'm not sure encouraging using integers as node names is a good idea: it will forbid using XML config files (tag names and attributes names cannot be numbers)

@stof this is a very well defined edge case to port legacy systems. Is not a BC and we can add a note on the documentation for this to avoid doing this for new systems.

yeah, and it is true that ``5`` will cause the same issue with XML than ``0``
