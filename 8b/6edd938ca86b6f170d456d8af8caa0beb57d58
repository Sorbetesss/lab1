Does this change do anything? We should already implement through `Http\Client\HttpClient`.

You should be right, but I still prefer adding this code now since it's going to stay in v7

So the plan is to not implement the HTTPlug interface anymore in v7? Does the name `HttplugClient` still make sense then or should we rather add a `PsrClient` as a replacement?

@derrabus not the *sync* interface, as it is deprecated in favor of the PSR-18 one (the sync Httplug interface is already an empty one extending the PSR-18 one). the client will still implement the async interface (and the PSR-18 one).

and we *already* have a Psr18Client that implements only the PSR interfaces

Ah, got it, thanks.
