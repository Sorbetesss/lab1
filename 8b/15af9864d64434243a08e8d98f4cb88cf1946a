This is the same BC break as in ##14330. You get a warning for overwritten method that the signature is not the same: https://3v4l.org/ruPcK

But I'm :+1: to add callable typehints.

@Tobion in this PR, it is OK:

- constructors don't need to have a matching signature
- most other classes are not meant to be extended (the only case I see is ``Command``, and you won't override ``setCode`` in such case but ``execute``)

@nicolas-grekas ``HttpKernelTest::testHandleWhenTheControllerIsNotACallable`` is broken here

and it would be great to fix the deps=low tests of the Translation component

I added more callable type hints that should all qualify as constructors or methods not meant to be extended.
@stof I'll look at deps=low tests if you look at #16097 ;-)
