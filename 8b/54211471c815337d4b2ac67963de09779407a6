This should probably be done in the branch where the BC was introduced.

Edited: looks like it's only in master.

The commit 466a3d70b7972dbac20264c254351ca31ee5c476 was **reverting** a BC break

so I'm -1 for this pR, at least in its current form. It implements a new feature, but reintroduces the previous BC break by default

I missed the fact that https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/466a3d70b7972dbac20264c254351ca31ee5c476 reverted a BC break. Whitespaces were previously ignored so it works as intended.

I've kept the test because none of them contains whitespaces despite the Cdata one (which was part of the confusion).

:+1: now that it only adds an extra test
