It looks like an edge case to me. I think that you should be explicit about the "empty" body by using `->text('')` explicitly. So, I'm ðŸ‘Ž for this change.

This creates first - empty part of mime message which does not work for me - one application I'm maintaining exchanges data with other service via email - and this have to be only one attachment with specific title.

Currently app relies on swiftmailer, where adding attachment creates only one part - as expected.
