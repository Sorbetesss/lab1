So just that I understand correctly - the deps=high tests will be fixed as soon as everything is merged into master, right?

Yes, deps=high install 3.0 components, that currently do not have your patch included.
There is one remaining issue: per-components tests for FrameworkBundle and TwigBridge **2.6** tests fail because the **2.7** Form that is installed as a dep by composer does not work with the 2.6 test suite.
