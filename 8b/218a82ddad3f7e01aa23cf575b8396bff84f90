Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 7.1 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Btw. I added this to google translate and got a "did you mean?"

Is this correct or is it just a bad suggestion?

Hello,
Is bad suggestion because on word "επιτρεπομενες" need the tone on the "o".The correct word is "επιτρεπόμενες". So if you can change this exactly word the translate will be perfect.And sorry for the confusion it was my first pr.

Okey. Thank you for confirming.

> And sorry for the confusion it was my first pr.

No worries. When I did my first contribution to Symfony, I opened an issue saying "here are the missing translations". So you are already doing way better than I did =)

Now we just need to wait for a second maintainer to review this. Hopefully it will be merged within the next 2-3 days.
Thank you again for your help.
