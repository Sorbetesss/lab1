What do you think of renaming the bridge to `MicrosoftTeams` or `MsTeams`?

We use it differently across the bridges:

As we are lacking tests for the many new classes I would like to introduce the bridge without custom options and rework the options part in another follow up PR.

In this case we have a bridge which can send chat messages to MicrosoftTeams, which is more than we are supporting right now.

WDYT @Nyholm @jderusse ?

Adding options in another PR works for me, that's what we did in the past for another provider (I don't remember which one though).

Could you do a quick rebase before merge?
