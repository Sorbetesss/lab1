should we actually have this extra configuration ? couldn't we just make the switch_user listener stateless when the firewall itself is stateless ?

@stof ideally yes, like the exceptionlistener. But disabling the redirection for stateless firewalls now would be a BC Break right?

should we plan any deprecation here? Like when the option doesn't match the statelessyness of the firewall, then plan to deprecate the option in 4.1 and make it automatic meanwhile?
