i think we should target master for this, as a new feature. IMHO a deprecation is not really worth it, so :+1: for throwing.

Well, the code of the validator already expects the right class due to property being used. So these are about providing a good error message in case you mess your project configuration, but it probably already does not work (with a crappier error message) in case of such mess.
So :+1: for adding the exception directly.

@stof unless someone completely mimics the exepcted api with its own constraint class :}
