@fabpot
Feel free to specify the requirements in https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2020 (exactly https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2020/files#diff-4e353d9e86349c0daec425c628ad5688R32 ), eg do we want to keep `?` at the end or not (I would keep them, as during removal the sentence should be adjusted as well)
