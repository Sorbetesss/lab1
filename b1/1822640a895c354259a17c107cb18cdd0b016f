your proposal looks weird. Your PR on SonataCoreBundle would still alter the definition of `form.extension` service, meaning that the service would not receive the locator anymore, which may cause issues (as supporting private form type services depends on the new feature)

About "private", that's the reason why the pass now calls `setPublic(true)`.
I don't plan to rewrite Sonata, just doing the bare minimum to make it work with 3.3 (and 3.3 with Sonata).
This PR just reverts to 3.2 state - it's more BC friendly than making the legacy FormPass extend from the new FormPass, which changes its behavior.
Any better idea?
