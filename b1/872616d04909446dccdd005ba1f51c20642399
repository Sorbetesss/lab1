The region codes `XA` and `XB` in our region bundle don't look like countries. We should check them for mistakes.

But otherwise, I agree about this renaming, as this class deals with a subset of ICU regions, not with all regions, and so is a different concept.

You're right, i suggest to consistently ignore all "non" valid codes, as done in #28833 for languages

- Countries: http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag_validity
  - exclude `XA, XB`
  - ICU already excludes deprecated codes: https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/release-64-2/icu4c/source/data/region/en.txt#L302
- Scripts: http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_script_subtag_validity
  - exclude `Zzzz`

See also http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unknown_or_Invalid_Identifiers (we almost conform)

Do we agree excluding data is a new feature still?
