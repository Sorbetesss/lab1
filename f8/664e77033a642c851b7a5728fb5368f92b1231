@OskarStark Do you think it's possible to keep ownership of the commit to the original author?

I am not sure, I talked to @xabbuh and we decided to create a new PR, the repository of the original author is deleted and I don't have some access to get the commits somehow.

ok, fair enough, can you fixed fabbot issues (mainly array() -> [])?
Tests look broken as well for the added feature.

*normal* and *deps=low* build failures are not related to this change.

*deps=high* needs to be skipped

Looks like the tests are 💚
