Just `1048576`, same like it's used when error: `UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE` occurs.

actually, I prefer `1024 * 1024` as everyone understands where it comes from.

Then other parts should be changed too I guess =)

@stloyd The first code (before the commit) was using the computed value. I already asked the change when reviewing the PR live.

And anyway, OPCache will probably be able to optimize this computation according to what @jpauli presented yesterday (unless it works only for additions, which would be weird)

and yeah, changing it on line 50 would be logical
