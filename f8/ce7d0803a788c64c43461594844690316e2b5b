shouldn't this be escaped with `htmlspecialchars()` instead?

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988 says `quoted-string` from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616

quoted-string:
> A string of text is parsed as a single word if it is quoted using
   double-quote marks.

       quoted-string  = ( <"> *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) <"> )
       qdtext         = <any TEXT except <">>

>   The backslash character ("\") MAY be used as a single-character
   quoting mechanism only within quoted-string and comment constructs.
