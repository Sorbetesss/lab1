>This misses the update of the ContainerBuilder merging to copy the deprecations.

Thanks for the heads-up :), fixed!

The new implementation does not trigger deprecations in the API itself, so the label can be removed.
Thanks for the reviews.

While trying the feature I realized that the `FrozenParameterBag` fails to trigger a deprecation due to property visibility in `parent::get()`.
I've added a test that covers this and fixed it by using `protected`, the property remains immutable anyway thanks to the exception in `deprecate()` (now covered as well).
