this should probably be reported to APCu though, as it means there is a bug in it

In fact, I just realised that this might be fixed by the recent release of 4.0.8 (https://github.com/krakjoe/apcu/issues/67)

Still failing with 4.0.8 (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nicolas-grekas/symfony/build/1.0.8#L950)
Reverting to the workaround...
