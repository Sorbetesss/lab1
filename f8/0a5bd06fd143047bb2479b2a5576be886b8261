@alexandre-daubois Can you have a look at the failing tests?

@fabpot I fixed tests by adding `"psr/event-dispatcher": "^1"` to `Postmark/composer.json`. I think remaining tests will be fixed when packages will be created and once this branch is fully back ported to earlier versions. Don't hesitate to tell me, @nicolas-grekas, if you need any help/new PR to ease this work! 👍

For your information, we never backport pull requests.

Right! This one's a bit special as this was a request from Nicolas to target 6.3 before backporting it. I'll do the appropriate updates if this needs to be changed 🙂
