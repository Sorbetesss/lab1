I've added it to the LanguageType and added also the tests...

When a language doesn't have a three letter code, it doesn't appear in the collection (behavior of Language::getAlpha3Names )..
Maybe this can cause confusion.. do you think a fallback to 2-letter codes for languages which doesn't have three letter codes would be appropriate?
