Thank you for this PR.
I had that block in my initial PR (#24435). I think it is a good way to opt-out form having the errors in the labels. However, I would strongly recommend against opting-out.

Btw, This is a **feature** and not a bug.

Protip: There is no need of closing the PR and open a new one. Just push your changes to the same branch and the PR will be updated.

Made the previous pull request in the wrong branch and it collects all the differences & shown as comments... that's why I prefer to close it & open another one.

Thanks!

@Nyholm This a is a new feature that we want to introduce in the 3.4 branch, shouldn't it go to master instead ?

Okey, Lets consider it a bugfix then. It is for users that does not use `form_row`. They will have a (real) hard time customizing the the form.

If somebody needs to do this on per-field basis, this is better approach:
```twig
{{ form_label(addUserForm.userByEmail, null, {errors: []}) }}
```

If you want to disable all errors for form, you can currently do this:
```twig
{% form_theme addUserForm _self %}
{% block form_errors %}{% endblock %}
```

This PR is still a bit different though, because someone might want to disable errors in labels, but not errors via `form_errors`

Exactly. The point is not to disable errors. The point is to disable errors **in labels**.

@ostrolucky didn't know you could disable errors per-field like that. Thanks for the hint!

As _form_errors_ call was removed from _form_row_ in this [commit](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/a0b40f5c4a5d46a2df789d223b46b91e08b339f8#diff-62cb2a10f5a37db0e87e3bd81609b17dL172), will disabling errors in labels cause error blocks to be not rendered at all?

A simple way to restore old behavior could be useful as errors in labels don't play nice with some Bootstrap 4 themes.
