Just a curious.

What is a standard way to check OS in Symfony?

At some places it is check DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, in another places it is strpos(PHP_OS, "WIN") === 0.

@ewgRa We always check the value of the `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` constant. There shouldn't be any other checks anymore (we unified that some time ago).
