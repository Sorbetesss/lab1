IIUC, this doesn't fix #57398, which is about allowing base58 UUIDs. Did I miss something?

That's right, I think I mixed up the issues. But I guess this opens up the way to accepting multiple formats in Uuid and Ulid constraints. I guess it would worth on or two follow-up PRs:

- Supporting RFC4122 in Ulid
- Supporting Base58 in Uuid

What do you think?

Apparently there is a need for that yes :)
