Good catch. I'd suggest being more aggressive and just not list those services, and do it on 6.2. WDYT?

@nicolas-grekas I think your proposal would make even more sense: no point in showing the service details for a class that is not, well, a service. üòÑ  Will update my PR for that üëç

@nicolas-grekas so I updated the implementation: now based on 6.2 and I just excluded the services from the choice list.

However a probably better implementation would be to add a `ContainerBuilder::getNonExcludedServiceIds()` (naming tbd) and just use that? This way it would also more or less directly work in the table view of this command.

And if we go that route, should I just look up every definition in this call and check or is there a smarter way?
