Could you change https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Tests/Fixtures/yaml/badtag2.yml#L6 to use
```
tags:
    - { foo: bar }
````

because it was confusing me. In theory with a hash structure like in

```
tags:
    foo_tag:   { foo: bar }
```

`foo_tag` could be used as name IMO. It's just not implemented like this yet so far.

@Tobion this would be a bad idea, because it is perfectly valid to have multiple tags with the same name on a service

@stof it would not be a bad idea because it would be optional and most of the time you don't have the same tag multiple times.

We should also add a check to ensure that the loading fails when the tag name is present but an empty string.

Status: Needs work

I would say no to

```yaml
tags:
    foo_tag:   { foo: bar }
```

It's a new feature that adds nothing special, and introduces an inconsistency.
If you look at the php and xml loader, then yaml would be only one to support this 'strange' format.

Tests are updated and I added some more checks for empty tag names.

Why this strange naming and numbering `badtag2.xml` and `badtag5.xml` for fixtures? Please use more descriptive names.
