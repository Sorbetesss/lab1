Here is a screenshot:

Note:
- the ellipsis, they make lines  shorter while still allowing one to select/copy/paste the full path
- the tooltip on hover that shows what the ellipsis hide
- when a fileLinkFormat is provided, the middle line is clickable and opens the IDE
- (colors are going to change soon don't worry about them :) )
