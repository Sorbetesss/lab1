This looks nice üëç  Thanks for the config example in the description. This will help the Doc team when this feature has to be documented.

Since creating HttpCache outside of the framework was done for perf purpose, I did some benchmarks.
Here are my numbers:

 | Enabling point | index.php | framework.yaml
| ------------- | --- | ---
 | Without preloading | 2150 r/s | 1680 r/s
 | With preloading | 2400 r/s | 2315 r/s
