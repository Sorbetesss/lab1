Should target 3.4 now.

Seems that a final 2.8 release is coming? (Just has another PR merged.)

Yes, but since this is going to be the final one, we shouldn't merge behavior changes that have even a slight breaking potential. So it's safer for 3.4 now.

As there is a potential BC break, this should be done in master.
