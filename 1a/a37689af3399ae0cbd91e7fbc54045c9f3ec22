i can't figure out why the CI-build is broken.

any ideas?

seems like ```master```is the problem, not the commit, or?

I think this should be considered as a bugfix, and so applied in older branches

I think it should be applied on top of 2.6, because [these changes](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/28edd30007aee351757260282856fa089d44b6e3) were introduced there: [Choose the right Branch](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html#choose-the-right-branch).

@phansys looks like the code was moved there, but not initial written
