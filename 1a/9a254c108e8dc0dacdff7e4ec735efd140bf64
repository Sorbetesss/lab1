rebase unlocked - the same should also apply to internal methods, isn't it?

rebased

Edit: known issue, when you extend a method of an inherited trait, the deprecation will show the name of the class using the trait instead of the name of the trait itself. I didn't find a workaround but I think it's still better than no warning at all.

fabbot failure is a false-positive. Travis and appveyor failures are unrelated.
