I'm confused. PECL tells me that 1.9.0 is the most recent release.

There is no tag `1.10.0` on https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver either.

So the latest version of the PHP package is 1.8. See https://packagist.org/packages/mongodb/mongodb

The PHP extension's latest version is 1.9.

Why do you want to update this in the first place?

Installing `mongodb/mongodb` 1.9 used to work before. It's now failing since mongodb/mongo-php-library#809 as in that PR the requirement for ext-mongodb was bumped to 1.10.

@xabbuh the PR you linked is not part of mongodb/mongodb 1.9 though.

ah sorry, there is non 1.9.0 release of `mongodb/mongodb` yet. so the previous code was forcing to use an in-progress dev version of the library.

I would still use `^1.8.0` as the requirement, and change the title of the PR. The issue we have is not that we should forbid installing 1.9 of the library, but that we should allow installing a released version (then, composer will take care of selecting the version compatible with the extension, for which we use a released version too)

I have removed the version constraint completely. I think that should be enough then.
