:+1: but this should be merged in 2.3

Should I reopen a PR against 2.3? And what about fixing fabbot?

@pyrech fabbot is a private tool currently, so only some people can fix that (but I'm sure they will). You don't have to open this for 2.3, @fabpot has a tool which can patch this perfectly in there.
