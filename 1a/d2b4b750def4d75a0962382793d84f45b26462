doing a composer self-update should be done before the call to ``composer install``, and then you won't need to dump the autoloader again.

And anyway, given Travis rebuilt their VMs recently, is it needed to update it for each build ?

wouldn't it be better to name it ``SYMFONY_PHP_COMPAT`` as it is in Symfony ?

are those really needed ? We won't support 5.2 and older anyway
