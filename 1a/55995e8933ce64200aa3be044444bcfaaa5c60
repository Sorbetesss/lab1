Both the ``server:status`` and ``server:stop`` commands have to rely on the fact that the ``server:status`` command terminates the proper process. The usage of ``exec`` is required for this to work as expected. Thus, #11335 or a similar solution needs to be merged first (currently, this change is based on the modifications made for #11335).

I modified this a bit. The pull request is no longer based off #11335. Instead the script that is executed by the ``start:start`` command is built manually which was way easier than I had expected.

Any thoughts on this?

I've not tried it but it looks good to me.

@romainneutron should give you some feedback soon...

It would be nice to add correct exitcodes (0 on success, other codes in case of failures)

@romainneutron I added 1 where necessary. 0 is the default behaviour. Do you think it makes sense to return 0 explicitly?

No need to return 0 in case the command was successful

The lock management could/should use #10475  (but it's not yet merged)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can then have another look.

by xabbuh at 2014-09-03T17:28:40Z

I addressed your other suggestions.

Thanks for the feedback.

I'm :+1: on this one (once my last comment would be addressed)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-09-21T18:38:53Z

Any other opinion on this?
