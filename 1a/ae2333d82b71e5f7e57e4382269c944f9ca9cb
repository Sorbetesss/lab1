Okay, so the tests fail because `phpdocumentor/typeresolver` only parses nullable types from v0.3.0 onwards, and we require v0.2.1+. Should I bump the dependency or make the tests conditional?

Given 0.3 supports 5.5, which is the minimum version of Symfony 3.4, I think it's fine bumping.

@nicolas-grekas I fixed the dependency (& tests are working now) :)
