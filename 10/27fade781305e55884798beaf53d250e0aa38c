Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.1 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

@jderusse given you approved, did you mean "good"?

> `session_token` is ephemeral. Having an option for this sounds weird to me. We already accepted a similar PR for SES ([#42982 (review)](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/42982#pullrequestreview-751917235))

I saw what you wrote in the other PR, and it's true that the sdk can use environmental variables instead, and have no configuration in options

However I've had cases with multiple credentials where I wanted to control to which account I wanted to connect

Environmental variables have fixed names and can only keep one set of credentials, but if you use symfony config you can specify custom variable names

eg.
```
            primary_transport:
                dsn: "%env(PRIMARY_SQS_URL)%"
                options:
                    region: eu-west-1
                    access_key: "%env(PRIMARY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)%"
                    secret_key: "%env(PRIMARY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)%"
                    session_token: "%env(PRIMARY_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN)%"

            transport_in_another_account:
                dsn: "%env(SECONDARY_SQS_URL)%"
                options:
                    region: eu-west-1
                    access_key: "%env(SECONDARY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)%"
                    secret_key: "%env(SECONDARY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)%"
                    session_token: "%env(SECONDARY_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN)%"

```

@filkaris that's a very good use-case. Thank you for the snippet.
