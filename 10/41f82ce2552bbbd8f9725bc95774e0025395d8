Could you help me to fix tests?

I am afraid I will not be of much help here (I tried to do that before in #22836 but then excluded this part as I didn't manage to make the tests pass)

Ok, I see your previous comment here https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22836#issuecomment-310990838. I'll try more...

Tests are failing because half of the places removing the usage of the field in conditionals performed the wrong replacement, making the code equivalent to *disabling* enhanced compat all the time instead of enabling it all the time.

Green tests!
