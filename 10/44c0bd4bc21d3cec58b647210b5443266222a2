Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.x branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Do we really need a new method? Can't we update `strlenWithoutDecoration()` instead? (I may miss some potential issues due to the behavior change.)
The name of the new method does not make it obvious that it is all about strings.
So if we cannot just update `strlenWithoutDecoration()`, we should try to find a more meaningful name. Perhaps `stringWidthWithoutDecoration()` or similar?

Hello @chalasr, thanks for the feedback. Since the method is used in 13 other places in the code, I was afraid it would break something. But after trying it and running the tests, it seems it doesn't :+1:
