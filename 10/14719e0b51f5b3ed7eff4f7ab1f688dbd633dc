What about `auto_append_file`?

auto_append_file is bugged also, but we can't do anything about it, there is no sane way to detect that the filewill not be included.

Do we really need to support it here? Would it be better to just wait for the PHP bug fix? I mean, how many Symfony users are using this "weird" PHP feature anyway?

I rely on this to have a consistent debugging env (think `dump()`) all the time.
