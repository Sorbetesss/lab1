What about fixing the constraints between the Form component and WebProfileBundle instead?

@fabpot What will happen on the existing application requiring already theses versions (so with the bug) ?

The bug will still be there I suppose... but that's the same with your fix... you need to update to get it. I prefer to avoid having too many specific code to support different versions, bumping min versions is usually what we do.

What is the version we would have to require to not have to use this code?

That's what I'm looking into, need to search @xabbuh

@fabpot I've added a conflict in the WebProfilerBundle to avoid using the Form component below 4.3 since there are no real dependencies between the two, WDYT ?
