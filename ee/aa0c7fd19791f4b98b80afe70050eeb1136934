Why do we even return the command ? IMO we should instead return a boolean specifiing whether or not the command was added to the application.

What do you suggest to do with `false` result? Try to add command again?

Nothing in the core but it might be useful in third party libraries. At least more that returning one of the parameter passed.

it is done so you chain things up like;
```php
$app->add(new MyCommand())->myCommandMethod('called after construction and adding');
```

this only works if you always get an object back.
So it might make more sense to either throw an exception or allow adding a disabled command so it can be enabled later on and still be used. (and updating the PHPDoc and test would be nice as well ;) )

I think the behavior was correct, just need to update the docblock.

Updated the doc and the return value.
SF switched to explicit `null` return to support the new return `void` 'type' right?
(i.e. fabbot is wrong on this one)

I think that `@return bool` is poor replacement for exceptions when it is supposed to describe whether command (in general meaning of this term, not CLI one) succeeded.

@unkind I agree, I would expect that the only returned value is the Command added and if it wasn't an exception was thrown. But I think the PR is a nice compromise, having a correct PHPDoc is a nice little improvement, I don't want the PR to grow bigger than needed :)

cleaned up to the minimal of changes to get the type hint correct on end points
