Nice feature. Useful to return a 410 when a page is removed.

Sorry about all the commits - I am still getting my head around rebasing (I normally do merging instead). PR should be in a good state now for final review.

The failed tests on TravisCI (PHP 7.2 build) seem unrelated to my change

There are a lot of commits in the PR that don't belong here. Can you sort that out?

I am trying - I just still don't understand rebasing yet. Every time I do it I am prompted to fix loads of conflicts and end up with loads of extra commits on the PR ðŸ˜ž

To help finish this PR, I've squashed the commits, and rebased on the current 5.4 branch.
