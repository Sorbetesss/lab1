At least, the behavior must be consistent between `PropertyInfoLoader` and this one don't you think?

The current behavior makes it harder to use this class when using only the component (without framework bundle). I'm favor of patching FrameworkBundle instead.

Deregistering the loader service when no regex is configured would solve that, right?

Indeed, itâ€™s what I have in mind.

@xabbuh implemented, could you check if it's ok for you now?
