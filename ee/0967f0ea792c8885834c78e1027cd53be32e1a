Same as for the other PR, could you have some tests? :)

The tests are failing. Looks like some infinite loop because the tests for the component just never ends. Can you look at it? Also, I believe we should use inject the `logger` within the decorators now that it's possible: inject it to the command and to the receivers.

I've reproduced it. I'll try to fix soon

Test fixed.
MaximumCounterReceiver doesn't increase its internal counter anymore when receiving null message, so it will never stop :p

I don't like naming of these. IMO it should signify what's being done when limit is exceeded. Otherwise, there will be confusion when somebody implements receiver with same trigger but another action. Also, I had no idea what it does until I looked into code. I thought it will just wait until memory is freed up or it will try to release some memory.

MaximumCountReceiver -> AbortWhenMaximumCountIsExceededReceiver
MemoryLimitReceiver -> AbortWhenMaximumMemoryIsExceededReceiver

That's a fair point you have here @ostrolucky. Though, no need to "maximum" if we already have "exceeded". Also, the receivers have this notion of "stop", so I'd suggest:
- `MaximumCountReceiver` -> `StopWhenMessageCountIsExceededReceiver`
- `MemoryLimitReceiver` -> `StopWhenMemoryUsageIsExceededReceiver`

@fabpot could you update your review please?

@sdelicata please squash your commits into a single commit. some commit seems to be authored with a different email, so we cannot squash them.
