It seems that the tests fail for an unrelated reason.

Don't you also have to update some dep versions in some composer.json files?

This will be done in the 3.0 and 2.8 branches.

@csarrazi can you open the sibling PR you're thinking about please?

AppVeyor builds fail because of an issue in the Console component (unrelated to this PR).

Related PR #18201 should be merged afterward, to release the version requirement on the `3.0` branch.
