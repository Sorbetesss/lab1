Could you please add a test case?

I just updated the existing tests.

Absolute path support has been removed in Symfony 4.0, so this PR should be:
- fully merged in all maintained 3.x branches (i.e. 3.4)
- and only the file `src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Templating/TemplateNameParser.php` should be merged to 4.x branches (to remove the issue residue, but the tests are no longer relevant for 4.x versions)
- in 5.x/develop branches there is no such code (not even under different file name)
