The Travis error does not seem to be related to my PR... Can someone from the core tell me if this has any chance to be accepted? Do I need to prepare a documentation PR?

@zefrog Looks good to me. Can you create a doc PR?

I've added the firewall entry in the configuration reference and made a cookbook page describing how to use pre authenticated listeners. Is that ok?

@fabpot will this feature be integrated in the next 2.6 release ?

Thx.
