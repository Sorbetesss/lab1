Regarding the phar error in the DI tests, I suggest to check whether the phar is a compressed one. HHVM does not support compressed phars: https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/4263

And the HttpKernel tests are passing, but they are polluting the output

@nicolas-grekas I suggest adding a checklist in the PR description with all components which are failing in the 2.3 branch currently, and then checking them when fixed. This would make it easier to follow the PR progress
