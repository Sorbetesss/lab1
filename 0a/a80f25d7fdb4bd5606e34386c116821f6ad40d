Would it be possible to write a test covering the actual bug (i.e. checking that ``getMappedClasses`` works) instead of asserting the internal property ? it would be more reliable (the class is free to do what it wants with its private property as long as the public API works fine)

The property is protected, so it's a "public" side effect, which means the test is good :)

@stof is this PR ok for you?

Note that this PR is against 2.7. `getMappedClasses` exists only on 3.2
