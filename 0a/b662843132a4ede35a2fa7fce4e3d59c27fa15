It seems there is no deprecation in your PR, wrong description or WIP?

Not sure :) i tend to think it solves more then it would break. Right now all cookies are dealt with in a consistent manner, which is good.

However we could lose some raw cookie attributes though, and people benefit from this bug before in terms of preserving those attributes. I think `Cookie` should fix this in terms of getting the same output string for the given input string. Which means no BC break :)

The synchronization is also missing in `all`, `has`, etc. Should this go all the way?

Or what about the other way around? Add a `Set-Cookie` header from `setCookie()`.

Rebased with the latest cookie changes. Still all good :)
