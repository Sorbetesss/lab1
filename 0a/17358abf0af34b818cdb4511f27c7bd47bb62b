As we are listing alternatives in a lot of different places in the framework, wouldn't it make sense to change the sort for all of them?

Have you had time to have a look at the other exceptions using alternatives to see if sorting them would also make sense?

I thought of this yesterday, and it's more or less related; wouldn't it be nice to filter the command list if a command is not found?

Ie. `bin/console` vs. `bin/console keyword` render the same output, but the latter only shows matching commands and some little info like _"Showing 1 of 3 commands matching 'keyword'"_.

@javiereguiluz Any news?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@javiereguiluz Still interested in finishing this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes ... but I don't know where to look for more places where this feature could be implemented. Anyone can give me a clue? Thanks!

I think looking for `levenshtein` in the code base would give you all the places where we need to make the same change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've committed some changes:

* For the list of commands, I think that sorting best matches alphabetically is the most natural thing...
* ... but for the other levenshtein candidates (service ids, param names, etc.) I propose to sort them from best to worst (i.e. from lowest to highest levenshtein distance)

Tests fail on deps=low, we should find a way to fix that.

I can't see which is the error that makes test fail for "deps = low". Can anyone help me? Thanks!

---

Some context --> The original test was:

```
Did you mean one of these: "bar", "baz"?
```

But after this PR, that fails on most Symfony versions, so I changed it to:

```
Did you mean one of these: "baz", "bar"?
```

and now test pass ... except when using "deps = low", which fails because the expected output is again:

```
Did you mean one of these: "bar", "baz"?
```

@javiereguiluz my guess is that the DependencyInjection needs a higher console version for that as it seems like it's the DependencyInjection component that fails. I could be wrong though, but that's my hunch after seeing the failure.

After thinking about this, what if we do the following:

1) Remove the last 3 commits
2) Keep only the original feature that sorts commands alphabetically

Reason:

We already show very good alternatives because we limit the levenhstein cost to < 3, so every alternative displayed is almost as good as the other ones. The proposed changes wouldn't make the results much better.

What do you think?

Make sense 👍
