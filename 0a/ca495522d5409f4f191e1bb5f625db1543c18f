Could you please merge all your CS PRs in one PR per branch?

Easier to discuss when they are separated, also some are bigger ones (like https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/20352/files), I don't want to make 1k lines PR :|
maybe check and approve first, then combine if needed ?

As GitHub supports reviewing commits one by one having one big PR shouldn't be an issue.

Review done, all look fine to me, see minor comments.
There are some trailing spaces remaining in the code also if you'd like to look at them.
Good to merge in one PR :)
