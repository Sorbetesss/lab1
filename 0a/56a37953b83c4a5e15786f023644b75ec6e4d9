The BC break should be removed, as we have a policy of not doing hard BC break: any future BC break needs to be announced with a runtime deprecation notice in 3.4.
So, the addition to the interface must be reverted, and another way should be found.

Which makes me wonder BTW: do we need TraceableEventDispatcherInterface at all? Is it really something we want ppl to be able to implement on their own? If no, then let's just deprecate it.

I think we could deprecate the interface

@stof @nicolas-grekas
Deprecated `TraceableEventDispatcherInterface`.

Moving to 4.1. Rebase on master might be needed, where PHP 7.1 features can be used btw.

Rebased, updated changelogs and `TraceableEventDispatcherInterface` deprecation notice with new target version.

@stof could you check updated code?

Tests failure looks unrelated.

Thanks @ro0NL for review.
Fixed everything you catched, including separate `TraceableEventDispatcher` check to not break code relying on `TraceableEventDispatcherInterface`.

deprecations will have to be documented in the `UPGRADE-4.1.md` and `UPGRADE-5.0.md`(to be created) files

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kejwmen at 2017-12-03T17:44:45Z

Rebased, deprecations documented in `UPGRADE`.

Thanks @xabbuh, I wasn't aware of that.

Rebased and corrected.
