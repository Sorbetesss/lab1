I think the renaming of other attributes at least deserves being in its own commit rather than being bundled in a commit saying `Add AsController attribute` in the git history.

@yceruto for all autoconfiguration attributes, I agree. I would not describe that as `for all attributes`. The routing and validator usages don't make sense if prefixed with `As`
