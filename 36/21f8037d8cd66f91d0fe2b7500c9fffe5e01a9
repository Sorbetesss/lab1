Great, I propose to merge such PRs in lower branches. ðŸ˜Ž

That's what I went for at first but I remembered that this topic was raised in my other PRs about test coverage, where it's merged in the highest branch possible ðŸ˜„ For example: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/52771#issuecomment-1905597295, https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/52746#pullrequestreview-1754583939

Yes, same for me ðŸ˜„

There's nothing wrong with increasing test coverage on LTS branches. I'd say, go for it.

Suits me fine. I opened a follow-up for 6.4 and will do another for 7.1 for the remaining ones if this gets actually merged in 5.4
