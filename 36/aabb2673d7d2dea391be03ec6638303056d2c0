@fabpot Please close if we don't want to fix that inconsistency :)

I still don't get the use case to be very honest (get and set).

That was meant to be temporary Ã  priori, but we can't make it stop as a bugfix. So I'd say this can be merged, and we can deprecate the \Stringable support for both `get` and `set` on 6.2 (I can do the PR later in the weekend).

If we deprecate it in 6.2, let's not merge this PR.

But then `set` and `get` stay inconsistent in 6.x? I do not understand why you do not want to fix this.

Because we don't want people to use it as we will deprecate the feature in 6.2.

The thing is that it works on 5.4, so anyone relying on this will have their code breaks when upgrading to 6.x.
Probably not a big deal so let's reconsider if someone complains about it

Oh, I didn't remember that it used to work on 5.4. Let's merge then, but let's not forget the 6.2 PR to deprecate this.
