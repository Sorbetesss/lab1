I can see that this compiler pass makes the configuration of services a bit easier and less repetitive when using return types with PHP 7. To me it's fine to do the calls to the reflection API just during compile time and only when the classes haven't been configured explicitly. So I am 👍 on this feature.

I also think that it's a nice DX improvement. And it should not hurt as it is an opt-in feature. 👍
