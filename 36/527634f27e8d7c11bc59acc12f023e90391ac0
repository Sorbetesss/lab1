shouldn't `\is_array` come first ? As of PHP 7.2, this is highly optimized (as this is a special opcode)

actually it looks like putting is_array last is the fastest as of 7.2 :thinking:

i get the same results more or less locally on 5.6, 7.1 & 7.2. That is; puttting is_array last being the fastest
