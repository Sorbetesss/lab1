I forked this a while ago so that I could get the changes into my project.  It dawned on me that `Parser.php` needs modification to make these changes visible to the end-user...otherwise they are inaccessible (not sure why I didn't think of that originally).

My changes are in this commit (https://github.com/polyfractal/Yaml/commit/b0a08f32ea15e04d8e15c3ddecf84088033cf0ba), we should probably add something similar to this PR.

Awesome!  Can't wait for this to be merged so I can stop maintaining a separate fork :)

@nicolas-grekas you cannot give a +1 on your own PRs. It does not count :)

if so, you could amend your commit to keep him as contributor ;)
(git ci --amend --author="...")
