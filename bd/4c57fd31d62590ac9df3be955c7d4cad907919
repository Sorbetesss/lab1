I suggest building a new file flag-emoji.php, to convert country codes to flags. This new feature could enhance the Intl component by adding a convenient method, such as Countries::getFlag('GB'), which would return ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

@adnen-chouibi that feature does not depend on building a map. See https://github.com/thekelvinliu/country-code-emoji for the JS implementation of such a feature, which relies only on the knowledge of how emoji flags are encoded.
This is not even a work for the symfony/intl component IMO.
