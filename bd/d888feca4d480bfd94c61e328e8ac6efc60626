> How does that play with framework extra bundle when installed?

Sensio's loaders take precedence over these new loaders because of [their priority](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/23044/files#diff-0e793081ceb720201745c982a568903fR702).
To avoid having useless services in the container we could remove these new services in SensioFrameworkExtraBundle but that's not a requirement.
