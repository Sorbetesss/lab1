Shouldn't it target master instead of 2.7?

why is that, it is not a BC?

It might if some code rely on the message (very unlikely but you have the case with the tests), let's wait for fabpot pov anyway :)

We can change an exception message, which is not part of the BC promise. Nobody should ever rely on an exception message in code anyway.
