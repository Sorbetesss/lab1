Oops, had this ready yesterday but forgot to hit the submit button. ~I choose the master branch as I didn't think this warranted a merge in earlier branches. If that would be more appropriate, let me know and I'll change it..~

Thanks for the feed back in the previous PR & issue

@jrushlow the PR should target the lowest maintained symfony branch where this should be applied :wink: So would be good to rebase it and change the target to 3.4

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.4/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Encoder/PlaintextPasswordEncoder.php#L17

The maintainers will then merge this fix into the upper version branches
