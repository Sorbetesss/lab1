> What's about `psr/cache`

Nothing to do here. We haven't implemented the property type declarations of `psr/cache` 2 because that would have forced all users of `symfony/cache` to bump to `psr/cache` 2 which requires PHP 8.

In other words: `ext-psr` does not break our cache implementation (yet).

Shouldn't this target 5.2 (or 4.4), as it's a bugfix? (the previous bug reports fixed by this change were also about 5.2)

@wouterj No, because the change on our side that causes the compatibility problems with `ext-psr` was introduced with #40384. DependencyInjection < 5.3 and ServiceContracts < 2.4 are unaffected.

I have implemented @stof's suggestion. This means we're basically only allowing `^1.1` of the extension.
