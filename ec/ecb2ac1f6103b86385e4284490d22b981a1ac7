Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.3".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

@OskarStark wasn't sure about this, but totally fine by me. Rebase is easy here :)

That's the kind of changes we used to do in lower branches, but not anymore. I'm going to merge it in 6.2.
