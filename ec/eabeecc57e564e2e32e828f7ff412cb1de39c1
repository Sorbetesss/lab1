Looks good, thank you! You'd just need to add "key" to "getProvidedTypes()" - and add tests now to verify this works as expected of course as you mentionned.

Tests have been added, `key` has been added to `getProvidedTypes()` and an issue has been created for the documentation (currently blocked by another MR).
