PR is ready to merge. I can't reproduce the failures on the doctrine bridge with a fresh php7.
If someone can, please tell me where is the issue, otherwise the php7 on travis is broken and may be fixed tomorrow.

Upgrading to doctrine/orm ^2.4.6 as lowest version fixes the remaining test failures.

Reverted the doctrine upgrade: that was a temporary bug in php7
