IMHO, this is a new "feature".

The fact that infos in the toolbar are displayed using `inline-block` rather than `inline` means that they get hidden in block rather than truncated only at the max length (at least in firefox).
/cc @javiereguiluz as you are the one who developed most of the toolbar styles IIRC.

I agree that this should go in master.

Allright, master then.
