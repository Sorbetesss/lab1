In some app I had to create a simple in-template form theme to make the choice labels display their HTML contents properly. So, a big üëç  from me to this proposal. Thanks Christian!

@javiereguiluz I think this place was simply forgotten to be updated when the `label_html` option was introduced in 5.1.
