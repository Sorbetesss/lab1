Hey!

I think @Kocal has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Can you add a small test case also?

@chalasr @nicolas-grekas Thank you both for the feedback.
I changed the comment as suggested and added a test.

~~Unfortunately, I apparently messed up the PR base branch when trying to rebase it.~~

~~I folllowed these [rebasing instructions](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/pull_requests.html#rebase-your-pull-request) :~~

```
git checkout 6.3
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/6.3
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
git rebase 6.3
git push --force origin BRANCH_NAME
```

~~but it now looks like my PR includes all latest commits from the 6.3 branch.~~

~~I have tried a few things but no success :( Can you point me to an easy fix or should I submit a new PR ?~~

Rebasing issue seems kind of fixed now.

Sorry for the noise and the extra review for requests (automated).

> Can you add an entry in SecurityBundle/CHANGELOG.md?

Sure.
What is best ?

> Make login redirection logic available to programmatic login

or

> Make programmatic login return authenticator response

I suggest
> Make `Security::login()` return the authenticator response

Perfect, thanks. Done.
