when lowering the branch on gh interface, one needs to rebase the branch as well, as if not, he ends up with all commits from original base branch in his PR

all bugfixes deserve a test. please add one

Note that in this case, having a test might be complicated...

Yes it is. I try to fix the test to connect in cluster mode but i don't know how to do more.
