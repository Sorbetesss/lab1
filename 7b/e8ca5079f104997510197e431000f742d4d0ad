Thanks for the PR. Can you have a look at test failures please?

I’ve initially sumbitted the PR on a wrong base branch and I changed it later, but the build has not restarted, could you please restart it or should I push another commit to rebuild it?
Another thing: fabbot.io complains about a line that I’ve not touched, should I edit it or leave it as is?

@alekitto you can simply amend your commit and push it again (`git commit --amend && git push -f`) :)
