This will break applications that are using the old directory structure and just update their dependencies using `composer update`.

@xabbuh right, but this is about default value for default directory structure 4.0, still you can use the `target` argument for old structures, no? or this kind of BC break is not allowed for 4.0?

Upgrade note added.

But still I'm not sure if we should add a warning messages on 3.4 on `assets:install`, WDYT?

4.0 can provide the target path as well ;-) it's not like we _must_ update on this side.

It does makes sense though :) however you need to trigger a deprecation in 3.4 first (if the argument is not given) i guess.

What about doing something similar to what I did in #23535?

@fabpot I've rebased to `3.3` base branch as a bugfix, also added BC for web directory :) thanks!
