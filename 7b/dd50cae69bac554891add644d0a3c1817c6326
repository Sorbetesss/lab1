Not sure what do with the fabbot.io failures as the offending code is in the dumped containers.

@realityking will you have some time to finish this nice pull request adding the minor changes asked by @nicolas-grekas? If not, we can make those minor changes ourselves. Thank you!

Sorry, I was distracted and then forgot all about this. Comments addressed, hope Travis runs succeeds this time.
