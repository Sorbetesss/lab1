I've just added a new test `\Symfony\Component\Yaml\Tests\ParserTest::testMultiLineStringLastResortParsing()` which shows that the `Inline::parse()` in the loop is a bad idea anyway.

The following yaml fails in 3.3 / 3.4 at the moment:

```yaml
test:
  You can have things that don't look like strings here
  true
  yes you can
```

At the moment this produces an exception because the `Inline::parse()` parses the `true` to a boolean.

moving to the 3.4 milestone as the last bugfix release for 3.3 was published today
