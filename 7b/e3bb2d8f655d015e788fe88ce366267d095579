I've added the `cookie_samesite` option to `\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Tests\Session\Storage\NativeSessionStorageTest`, only I've set it to the value of "lax" instead of "" as I think that's a more solid test; any string can be empty, getting a specific value is harder.

I've just added the change to `CHANGELOG.md` and created a PR for the docs: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/10202

I'm not sure why Travis is failing now. It seems to be missing the `symfony/var-dumper` package. Maybe that's broken on master now?
