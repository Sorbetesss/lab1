Why don't we remove the year from the copyright. Updating this every year is annoying, and makes unnecessary changes into all files.

because copyrights expire (theoretically). however, if a file hasn't even been updated, then the copyright probably shouldn't be touched.

This should be done against `2.7` and `2.8` branches I guess.
