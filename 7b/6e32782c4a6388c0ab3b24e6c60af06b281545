Didn't any tests fail without these changes?

No because it still returns an array behaving like an empty one (because keys of `$content` are usually service ids or class names and don't have any signifiant meaning as a service definition).

It's why it's very unlikely to introduce bugs, but it still needs to be fixed IMO.
