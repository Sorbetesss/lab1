If the "Symfony support" should be the link (not sure, can be a heading, based on screenshot), I'd add action verb. E.g.:

"Find help at Symfony support"
"Get help at Symfony support"
"Need support?"

@TomasVotruba What do you mean with "try link"? Somehow the link should be more visible.

@peterrehm Sorry, I meant "the link". The point was better visibility, yes. Stackoverflow icon might help as well.

@javiereguiluz What are your opinions on that?

The idea would be to redesign the exception page in the near term to match the new Symfon style. So for now, I like the current proposal.

@javiereguiluz Do you want for the current one the top link more visible or are you okay with it as it is?

I agree with @TomasVotruba the label should include an action instead of just a subject. I like "Need support?".

Btw, common design standards are to use buttons for on-page actions and links for actions that load a new page. Seems like this should be a link instead.

The link color should probably be just black as the contrast between grey and green seems very low.

@fabpot Updated accordingly.
