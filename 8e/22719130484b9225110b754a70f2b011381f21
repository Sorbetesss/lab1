I'm not convinced we should commit the docker-based setup in the VarDumper component. but if we do, it should be excluded from downloads in our `.gitattributes` file, as this is useless for people using the component.

I have no knowledge at all about rdkafka so I cannot know whether the caster is correct.

The docker part is not used in the CI. I don't think it's a good idea to add it here. We don't do that for other component

This is WIP code, I'll clean my mess and ask for a review once it's ready :)
