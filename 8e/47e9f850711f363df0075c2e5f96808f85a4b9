Could you please fill in the PR template in the description? If this is a bug, the PR should target the lowest branch where the bung is found (see PR description templates for details). A test case would be nice also. Thanks.

@xabbuh I met some difficulties with my github to modify my branch and have wrongly done modification on my master (popnikos/symfony github repo) and just use a merge master into my patch-1 branch (the one attached to this PR)

Could you please validate it anyway (because dthe `fabbot.io` consider this as an issue)?
