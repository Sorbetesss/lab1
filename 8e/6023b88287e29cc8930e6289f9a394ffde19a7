@nicolas-grekas About #20696, I just checked this out after your last commit and the result is that running `debug:container --parameter "env(database_url)"` gives the parameter placeholder (`"%env(database_url)%"`) and running `debug:container --parameters` gives the default parameter value.

It's quite better than the current output but as you can guess I expected to get the actual value of the parameter, which looks not possible actually. Does #20618 helps in that way?
Meantime,  shouldn't the output be consistent for `debug:config` and `debug:container` with both options (maybe always dump the placeholder)?

Anyway, thank you for this.
