What would be the drawback of always allowing the switch? Adding a new option should be thought twice.

We've discussed a bit about this with @chalasr. It's not easy to provide a satisfying default out-of-the-box
 to show an explanation about the error to the user anyway. I'd be in favor of always allowing the switch, and this could even be considered a bug fix to me.

@nicolas-grekas Did you mean 3.4?

3.4 then yes :)
