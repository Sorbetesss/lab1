why would you get ``['' => false]`` passed to the next step ? The value of a textarea does not end up in the keys.

but anyway, it makes sense to use an empty string. Textarea are textual fields

Because of this:

```
php > var_dump(http_build_query(array('example' => null), '', '&'));
string(0) ""
```

Then we attempt to find the variable name of that, so we do $varName = substr($s, 0, 0)
