@mtarld I've updated, is this what you had in mind with deprecation?

Should I skip those test cases on 32bit systems when value is > PHP_INT_MAX?

Either that or skip the int cast on those systems.

Anybody to review?

> Code looks good to me. But I'm wondering that maybe we can add a check to make sure that the cast value is consistent with the format? So that it won't be possible to cast `d/m/Y` to an `int` for example. WDYT?

But then we would go back to format guessing, which derrabus wanted to avoid :)
