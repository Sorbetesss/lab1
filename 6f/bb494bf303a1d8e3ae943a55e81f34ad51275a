We've removed usage or `realpath` in the past for various reasons. I don't think reintroducing here is a good idea.

I wasn't aware of this, but it makes sense.

What do you think the correct approach is ? Throwing an exception to avoid mirroring a bunch of useless data ?

Throwing might be a good idea (calling `realpath` in user's code is indeed a better "fix").

An exception is now thrown and I tried to be explicit with the error message.

The fabbot failure is a false negative.

(could you please rebase on latest 2.8 and fix the CS issues fabbot is reporting?)

Done!
