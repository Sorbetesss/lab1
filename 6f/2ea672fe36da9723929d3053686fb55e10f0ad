Tests are failing on travis due to an outdated assertion, unrelated to these changes.
See https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/19760

@chalasr Thanks for the fix. Actually, the tests should have failed before, but didn't because of the implementation inside the `ErrorAssert` that will be fixed by this PR.
