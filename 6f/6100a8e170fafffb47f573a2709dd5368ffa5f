If we want to allow symlinks here, we should do the same for the validation files. What do you think?

I agree. What about serialization files?

I added the followLinks on both serialization and validation files

@xabbuh Is it OK for you? Note that I don't understand why the travis build is in error for PHP5.3.
Any idea?

Looks like a new behavior, thus new feature to me. Am I wrong?

Agreed, to treat this as a new features.

Besides that üëç from me.

If you consider this as a new feature, do I need to rebase my branch on top of master or 3.2(as it's not released yet)?

New features should now go to `master` because `3.2` entered its "code freeze" period.

OK for me I changed the destination branch.
