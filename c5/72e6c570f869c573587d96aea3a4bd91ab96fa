The only downside is that there is no way to easily customize the chosen icon. Would it be possible to. do the same via CSS?

Bootstrap 4 does not have any icons included. They do have 8 base64 images in their CSS but none that we can use.
I do not like the idea do provide a "symfony-bootstrap4" css file.

A way to customize the icon would be to introduce a twig block and let the user to override it.

Not sure if it's relevant, but in EasyAdmin we use a word (`Error`) translated into the user's language instead of an icon:

![error-en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/36719943-cc94184e-1ba6-11e8-835e-9c96d5b719bb.png)

![error-ru](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/36719945-cdcf3fa4-1ba6-11e8-9d41-d2ebb14d0997.png)

In any case, no matter if we use an icon or a translated text, we should wrap it with `<span>` or something else so people can quickly hide it, change its styles, etc.

But that could be easily achieved on userland using CSS I guess. Bootstrap 4 does not showcase anything regarding this AFAIK, so if it's really a good practice recommended by the WCAG2, perhaps it should be fixed on bootstrap side rather than on our own by arbitrary choosing a way to make it more visual.

Otherwise, I do prefer the EasyAdmin way as shown by @javiereguiluz.

Yes, I do like that as well. Since we have that clear background and the word "error" it should be okey.

I've added the "error badge":

I need some guidance with where to put the translation for key "error". I would like to put it in the TwigBridge because that's where we use it. As alternative one could put it in the validator component.

I would also like to use the "validator" domain.

Any suggestions?

Another quick comment just for your consideration. In EasyAdmin, when there are multiple errors in a single field, to avoid displaying too many `ERROR` badges, we display a single `ERRORS` badge (in plural) and a `<ul>` of the error messages:

![multiple-errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73419/36808845-90814932-1cc6-11e8-8805-4a1d343b26f1.png)

But maybe this is too much attention to detail for Symfony core. Not sure.

the repeated "ERROR" label LGTM
but before merging, the composer.json of the Form component must be updated to conflict with symfony/twig-bridge `<3.4.5|<4.0.5,>=4.0`

I've added more translations. Fabbot is a false negative.
