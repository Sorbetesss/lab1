> We also need a sigchild-enabled PHP, which @derrabus knows how to build :)

Which 8.2.x release exactly do we want for that? We've always used an early release: 7.1.3, 7.2.5, 8.0.2, 8.1.2.

For 8.1, we use 8.1.0 (see appveyor), so I'd go with 8.2.0 on appveyor also.

Thanks! I'm AFK but managed to upload this to the binary-utils repo from my phone :)
Can you please send a PR to update the job accordingly?
