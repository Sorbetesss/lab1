> The contents of this PR are the exact same contents given by GitHub when clicking on "Add a Contributor Covenant based CoC".

It should then be updated to match what's in https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.html

But Symfony's CoC is Contributor Covenant 1.4. I tried (very hard) to make some minor changes and all of them were refused.

Our CoC mentions the CARE team, that's a requirement!

I'm going to propose some changes to the Symfony's CoC page. Let's keep this PR as WIP for now.

Also, we replaced the term "race" by "ethnic origin". This change is lost in this PR.

Interesting ðŸ¤” the presence of a file is not enough. it needs actual contents of a CoC, you can't only use a link (like I do), or it may it accepts if it has a title at least (edit: nope ðŸ˜‘ ).

Any news here? What's blocking from "just" copy/pasting the CoC we have?

Sorry for the late response! I've copy+pasted the Symfony's CoC, so this is ready. Thanks!
