The translations in the Security Core need to be updated equally.

@Tobion I can also work on those, do you prefer a separate PR?

It seems to me translations in Security Core are up to date since https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Resources/translations/security.it.xlf contains all the messages defined in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Resources/translations/security.en.xlf or am I missing something?
