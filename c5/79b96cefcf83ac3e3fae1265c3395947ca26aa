~~On the implementation side, would the `FilesystemIterator::SKIP_DOTS` flag work?~~
Note also that this would be consistent with how `glob()` and `Finder` work.

Skip dots only skips `.` and `..`.

Status: Needs Work

Edit: Doctrine bridge tests are failing for a different reason. Looking into it.
