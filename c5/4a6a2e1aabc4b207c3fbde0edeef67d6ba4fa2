It it really a mandatory requirement? Or just something you need if you use the related features?
2nd choice means there is not need to do this.

@nicolas-grekas the way we merged #30754 means that it's a technical requirement but it's a good shot actually.

Not unless you use `StopWorkersCommand`, which you don't have to.
For require-dev if we have tests.
