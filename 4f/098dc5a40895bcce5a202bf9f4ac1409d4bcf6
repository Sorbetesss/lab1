Do you know how to implement locking in Mongo to prevent race conditions? See #4976

MongoDB has DB level locking itself.
Are we really talking about read your own writes here?
If so, then updating the docs to specify a read preference may be enough without forcing it here.

Either way, that is an issue currently right, not created by this PR?

Hi, What needs to be done so this can be merged?

Any further comments here?

I have no further input. I think @stof can give this a final look, or some of the [core team voters](http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/contributing/code/core_team.html) can chime in.
