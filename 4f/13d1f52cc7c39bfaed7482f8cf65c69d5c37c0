Thank you for feedback, I'm agree, going to fix all that things and rebase tomorrow (my flight back home starts in few hours). Thank you, hacking day was a great expierence for me.

My mistake in merging/rebasing, need some time to fix.

And finally: fixed, squashed, rebased, ready for merge. @fabpot, @cordoval, is this PR OK now?
