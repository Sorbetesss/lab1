DBAL 2 is still more popular than we'd like it to be, despite being officially EOL for almost a year now. My plan was to drop support in Symfony 7. I didn't want apps to be locked on a non-LTS release because they haven't upgraded to DBAL 3 yet (for whatever reason).

I won't block the change, it's just that I think we should've talked about that. ðŸ™‚

For `Connection::PARAM_STR_ARRAY` vs `ArrayParameterType::STRING`, we could do conditional usages of those constants, as we did in the past for the migration to `ParameterType` when we still wanted to support older versions of DBAL without it.
Or we could just ignore them for now (`Connection::PARAM_STR_ARRAY` will only be removed in DBAL 4.0, which is not a thing yet)

This makes the code a bit ugly but OK, updated.
