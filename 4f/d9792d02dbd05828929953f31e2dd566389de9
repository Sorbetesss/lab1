Five steps forward in this PR:
- add some missing "Legacy" prefixes and silencing in tests
- add the first `@group legacy` annotations, required because of removed class/methods in 3.0 components
- add SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER=weak to components=high in Travis matrix
- move deprecations related failure triggering to the shutdown sequence
- fail in strict mode if a legacy test is not silenced
