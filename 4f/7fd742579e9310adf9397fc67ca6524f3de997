@stof some tests exist in 2.7 (it's how I've found I've broke things). I'll backport them ASAP but I've opened this PR right now because 2.3 is currently buggy.

well, this PR is the one where backporting makes sense, as the backport is adding the test preventing this regression

Test added

AppVeyor failures look unrelated.
