This feature was deprecated in 2.5, so this should be merged into 2.7

I'm not sure how to change where it should be merged other than to create a new pull request. Is that the only way?

@bradbyu Yes, that's the only way.

Except if the merger targets the right branch when merging ;-)
I don't know what's the policy in this repo.

Replaced with another pull request here https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/18779

Please merge this with 2.7 as mentioned by @weaverryan . The other pull request went wrong and I was told to reopen this one instead by @xabbuh

This should be merged into 3.0 isn't it?
We *removed* the attr in 3.0, or?

@nicolas-grekas
As per @weaverryan
"This feature was deprecated in 2.5, so this should be merged into 2.7"

I'm fine with it being merged with either. I can see valid cases for both.

If it's been deprecated in 2.5, the message you say deprecated, not removed, that's my point

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@nicolas-grekas this is the ``UPGRADE-3.0`` file
