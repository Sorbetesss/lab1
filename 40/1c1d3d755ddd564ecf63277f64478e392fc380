@Ioni14 thanks for your hard work on this feature!

A minor question: could we maintain the global `default_options` option ... but remove it from the individual HTTP clients? In the example you showed in the description, we'd maintain the first `default_options` but we'd remove the other two. Don't they look a bit redundant? Thanks.

@javiereguiluz thanks ;)

It's probably "YAGNI" but if we want to add other configuration keys for clients in the future it'll be useful to have `default_options`.

If/when #30547 is merged, the `auth` option in the config will need to change and the bearer_auth will need to be added.

Tests failing on low deps, but other than that - +1 from me!
