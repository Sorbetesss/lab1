@jakzal I see you've enhanced the test - but I'm confused (in part, because I honestly haven't spent much time looking into the template name parsing stuff): this doesn't contain a fix for #14804 or add a failing test case. Was this just a step 1 to enhance to test? Or am I missing something (or perhaps I haven't answered your questions well yet on #14804).

Thanks for taking this on - I see PR's from you fixing issues. It's awesome.

@weaverryan indeed. That's why it's marked WIP. I updated PR's description.

Few test cases are either wrong ("name.twig" and "name"), or we should treat them differently then templates that follow the "name.html.twig" pattern.

Are "name.twig" and "name" even valid template names?  I went with the second option for now to avoid changing existing cases.

@jakzal I don't know if `name` or `name.twig` should be valid (`name.twig` should in my opinion). Best to keep these as they are for BC.

I have some hard time wrapping my head around these changes, but the result looks like what we expect.
