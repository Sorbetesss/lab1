Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.3" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.2".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

@xabbuh / @derrabus

We spoked about this pull request. As discussed, I tested whether this error already existed in version 6.0, however it is only from version 6.2 onwards.

In AbstractObjectNormalizer.php, the block from line 311 to 324 has been added.

However the cause of the error is the array_merge() in line 324.

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6a9f47c6940e86f9cbb5d67867335cde3b1ce5f8/src/Symfony/Component/Serializer/Normalizer/AbstractObjectNormalizer.php#L311-L324

Therefore, an update from 5.4 LTS to 6.4 LTS will definitely result in a breaking change.

Can you please check and release this pull request as a second reviewer so that this fix goes into 6.4.

@elevado Can you rebase your changes on the `6.3` branch please?
