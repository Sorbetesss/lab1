Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.3 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Hi @xabbuh ,

It changes the format to the used locale notation. For me it keeps `,` and changes `.` to `,` like it should.

Hi @nicolas-grekas,

I fixed the issues in the tests and now it works for 7.2, 7.4 and 8.2 but not for 8.0 and 8.2. Any idea how I can fix it for the other 2?

isn't this contradicting the html5 option of the NumberType

```php
#\Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\NumberType
    public function buildView(FormView $view, FormInterface $form, array $options)
    {
        if ($options['html5']) {
            $view->vars['type'] = 'number';
        }
    }
```
The default is assuming the same default as the Type is, html5 is false by default, and thus is opted for text instead?

@esserj , thanks for pointing that out. That option is not needed anymore so I will remove it.

I'm gonna change this PR and put the steps: any attribute in the html5 option. This way it is fully BC.
