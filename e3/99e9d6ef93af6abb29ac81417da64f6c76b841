Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Maybe push channel #39402 should be merged before? :)

Now that the push channel feature has been merged (see #39402), I think this PR can be finished. @zairigimad Do you have time to update the code?

Yes, I will take some time today to update the code.

@fabpot I updated the code with the new PushChannel.
