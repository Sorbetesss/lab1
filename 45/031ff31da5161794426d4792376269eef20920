@webmozart I need you to look over this please.

@Tobion I propose to merge this one as @webmozart does not reply anyway to pings.

@fabpot What do you think about deprecating the unneeded argument in Symfony 3.1 (see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17398#discussion_r49938630)?

I'm not a big fan as this is a big BC break and makes supporting several versions difficult.

Looks good to me. @fabpot you think deprecating the argument is too much of a hassle even if we keep it until 4.0?

@webmozart For ExpressionValidator, yes. It means that the constructor signature is going to be different for 3.4 and 4.0, which makes writing libraries/projects compatible with both versions more difficult (think Silex for instance).

I think it's good to merge. If we want to deprecate the ExpressionValidator argument or the `validator.expression` service, we would need to do it in the master branch anyway.
