Thanks for this PR.
I like it but now the real logic (a transition is enabled if all places before it,  contain a token) exists at two different place (in `getEnabledTransitions` -> `doCan` and `can` method).
If you find a way to share this logic without adding some complexity it will be awesome.

Anyway I'm :+1:

This can not be considered as a bugfix ?
Do you have an idea to avoid this current behaviour in 3.3.* ?

IMHO this is not a bug fix as the current behavior (before this PR) is not buggy. This is just a performance optimization.

it's not possible.
