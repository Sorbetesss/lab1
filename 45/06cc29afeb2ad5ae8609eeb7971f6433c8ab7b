For the encoding one being considered as windows-1250 by default in the API, I would treat it as a bugfix, given that Symfony assumes UTF-8 by default in most places.

You are right, but in this case this PR should be slit into two PRs 🤷‍♂️

@stof @OskarStark We can leave this PR as new feature to 6.1 and I can prepare separate PR only with bugfix for encoding. If you prefer.

Please do so, we will merge the bugfix first then 👍🏻 thank you for your patience

@OskarStark PR only with bugfix #45174. This PR I've rebased to 6.1

PR title should be adjusted, the encoding was fixed in a different PR
