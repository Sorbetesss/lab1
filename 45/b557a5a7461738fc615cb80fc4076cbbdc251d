Since I haven't changed any code, I'd guess the CI build fails are unrelated to my change.

On second thought, if the method is overridden everything should work fine, doesn't it ?

@HeahDude: If the signatures of the methods don't match, php will throw a fatal error.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't think many people will run into this. Nevertheless, I think it's worth documenting.

I see a warning about signature mismatch, but not a fatal error, just did a little check

    class A {
        public function func() {
        }
    }

    class B extends A {
        public function func($a) {
        }
    }

    new B();

    Warning: Declaration of B::func($a) should be compatible with A::func()

@mcfedr PHP version ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-04-01T06:37:51Z

~~I confirm the fatal error~~ on PHP 5.6:
`Strict Standards: Declaration of ChildTest::test() should be compatible with Test::test() in /Users/Heah/Sites/home/web/test.php on line 30
true`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mcfedr at 2016-04-01T06:49:24Z

I am use php 7, I also see the Strict warning on php 5

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Either way, its probably worth noting in the UPDATE log

As this is not part of [the symfony BC policy](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html), I'm not sure this should be specified in the upgrade file. Maybe only in the changelog?

We didn't do that in the past when introducing more helper methods in Symfony 2.8. On the other hand it doesn't really hurt to add this and having a `json()` method might be more like than any of the other method names we added in the past.

I've added the extra blank line as requested by @HeahDude and rebased against master to resolve conflicts.
