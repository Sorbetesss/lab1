The DoctrineBridge needs an update of the `composer.json` file.

@xabbuh not sure: iconv is an implicit requirement now (same as ext-json)

@nicolas-grekas Is iconv even available on Windows by default?

@xabbuh yes, it's bundled on Windows without adding any dll, at least in the binaries provided on windows.php.net

Is the idea also to move the Intl component to Polyfill? Isn't the Intl component not basically a Polyfill or does it do more?

@Tobion there where a few missing require for symfony/polyfill-intl-icu that I fixed. I looked at symfony/intl and it's both a shim and a utility component. I added `@internal` tags to the shim-related classes. Moving the code to polyfill-intl-icu could be useful as a cleanup but it's a bigger work and it won't provide much practical value so I'd like to postpone it for later if we want it.
