Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 7.2 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

1. fabbot suggests me a fix with coding standards, but it's for a different part of the code. Should I apply?
2. Because of my mistake milestone was probably incorrectly set to 7.2 instead of 5.4, sorry

You can ignore fabbot suggestion that are unrelated to your code.

I've got a remark about this change. This is a behavior update, which seems indeed like a bug fix. However, many people could rely on the current behavior and this change could definitely bring a lot of unexpected breakages wherever this is used. This would mean a lot of BC breaks are to be expected which is not permitted by patch and minor versions bugfixes are targeting. ðŸ¤” Because of this, I'm not sure this can be accepted as-is. Curious to have the opinion of someone else.

Can you amend+push again to trigger tests? Strange they didn't run.
On my side this is a legit bugfix.
