The [test needs to be completed](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.7/src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/Tests/NodeVisitor/TranslationDefaultDomainNodeVisitorTest.php).

Was this the only file that had an issue? It's the only one that caused issues for me, but I wasn't sure if possibly some bad find/replace caused issues in other files.

And yea... it's not technically needed, but it would be awesome if the test was extended to catch this - it's surprising to see an error like this not caught by a test.

And mostly, thanks for the fast PR :)
