@jakzal thanks for your tip. Now is more simple and works fine. Do you think is ok to be merged? (after squash)

Also I do need to create an entry in documentation for the feature. Will take care of that.

@jakzal @fabpot is the implementation ok? Docs are already created as well.

Looks ok for me :+1:
On the other hand, is it possible to create some configuration option in config.yml for this feature?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@piotrpasich that is Framework related. Also I do think for the framework itself could not make so much sense to do that, but if it does IMO it should be a different PR

@danielcsgomes I'm not sure if this should be in second PR, but ok. We can open a new issue to remember about this change.

@piotrpasich I'm -1 for adding an option in `config.yml`. To me, the possibility to change the default command is very specific and probably never a good idea in the full-stack framework itself.

I see an issue here (something we faced in PhpSpec, where we finally chose to remove the overwrite of the default command for now): the default command cannot get arguments (the first one would be interpreted as a command name), so changing the default command will only be reliable if the custom command does not have arguments

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@stof That's to be expected as we are talking about a "default" command to be executed when **no** arguments are passed to the console application. So, this PR is different from #9564, where you might want to create a Console app with only 1 command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

yeah, I'm just warning that it might cause some issues if pople start expecting the command to work fully when using it as the default one

Well, I think @danielcsgomes did a good work at the documentation for this PR. The article clearly has 2 sections: setting the default and creating a one command app. Both explain other ways to do it, so I don't think people will get confused.
