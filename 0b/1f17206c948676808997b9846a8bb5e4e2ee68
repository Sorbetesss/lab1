ping @fabpot, @romainneutron or @xabbuh
Any opinion on this fix?

@pyrech I think this makes sense (though I don't have vote permissions).

However, we need to keep in mind that people might rely on this behaviour (for example, if you had a prefix containing a space, this won't now work anymore if you didn't do the escaping yourself).

Hello,

This is an error in the docblock. When I introduced it in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/7584, the purpose was to reuse the ProcessBuilder

@pyrech Can you fix the docblock instead?

Done :)
