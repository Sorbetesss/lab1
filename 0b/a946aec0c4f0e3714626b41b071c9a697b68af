Pinging @johnstevenson as he authored most of the xdebug-handler code. Feel free to ignore if not interested though :)

For the record:

Fabien documented how to write CHANGELOG.md files here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/14830

I guess this will work as well as `composer/xdebug-handler` does (which seems to be pretty well) with its limitation of not being able to detect extensions loaded on the command line.

Proper attribution for the `writeTmpIni` and `mergeLoadedConfig` methods would be useful, in my opinion.

Sure, would you mind adding a code review/suggestion as to how you'd like to have this being done? Might also just add yourself as an `@author`?

Rebased and addressed the remaining reviews.
