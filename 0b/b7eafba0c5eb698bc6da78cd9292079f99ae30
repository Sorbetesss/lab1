So to be clear, if you have a value with backslashes like a namespace you need to replace these before usage?

@sstok: You'll at least need to escape the last character if it's a backslash using `OutputFormatter::escape()`, or replace it by `<<`. If backslashes are not at the end (which means right before a `</info>` tag for instance here), it should not be an issue.

Maybe we can do this check before wrapping any user text into tags, and replace it automatically, but that probably means searching and updating a lot more places.

After all, I think there is only a few places that would require this special check, so it might be worth it and can be fixed within this very same PR IMHO.

@chalasr You can apply https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/2.7...ogizanagi:fix/2.7/console/trailing_backslashes if you think it makes sense, or I'll submit another PR once this one is merged.

@ogizanagi It makes good sense to me, thank you for the patch, applied.
