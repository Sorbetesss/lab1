@nicolas-grekas It seems that Translation component needs explicitly the Config component (due to usage of `XmlUtils` in `XliffFileLoader`). Should we move it from `required-dev` to `require`?

@fabpot I've just pushed a fix (adding symfony/config as dev dependency of the Lokalise Provider Bridge). It fixes tests on Travis. On AppVeyor, failures seems unrelated
