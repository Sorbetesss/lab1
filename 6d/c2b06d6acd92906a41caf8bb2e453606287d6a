Hi @kbond, you implemented the original version for Mailgun TagHeader support, are you the right person to ask for a review/feedback?

Thanks for your reply! Any change I can convince you to handle this as a bug? ðŸ˜„
Main reason is that multiple `TagHeader` does work with the `MailgunHttpTransport` and this PR fixes it for `MailgunApiTransport`.

I admit this feels like a bit of a grey area personally and I know the frustration of having to wait a few versions for a fix like this. I'm falling back on the established Symfony process and this would be considered a feature. The code isn't currently broken, it just doesn't allow a specific feature provided by Mailgun.

Oke fair enough, it was worth a try. I will rebase and target 6.1 :)
