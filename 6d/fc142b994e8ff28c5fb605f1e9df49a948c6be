I'm wondering whether it make sense to do that work in the 5.4 branch while 6.4 is likely to be the active LTS by the time of the Doctrine major releases.

We will maintain ORM 2 for quite a while, so only making Symfony 6 compatible with ORM 3 would be fine. A big problem is though, that no Symfony 5 package (except VarExporter) is actively conflicting with ORM 3. It's a dev dependency everywhere. So basically, people will be able to install ORM 3 with Symfony 5 and flood our tracker with bug reports. ðŸ˜¢

We could explicitly conflict with ORM 3 to avoid such situation

We could've done that two years ago, yes. If we do that now, Composer will just pin an old Doctrine Bridge and move on.
