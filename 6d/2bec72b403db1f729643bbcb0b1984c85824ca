IIRC this is fixed in 2.3.1 (which is released yesterday)

See also #8239

Edit: The PR fixing this is: #8193

Probably a stupid question, but did you clear your cache after updating? I had the same problem, and while composer clears the dev cache, it doesn't clear the test cache, so after updating while the dev environment worked fine, the tests kept on failing

if i clear my cache, check out 2.3 and run ``app/console | grep router`` i get nothing. if i then switch to this branch here. i get the 3 expected commands.

@fabpot this is quite urgent for the CMF (and any one else using the ChainRouter), as right now the router commands are broken with 2.3.

this is indeed needed. #8193 is fixing ``get`` but not ``has``
