The message that you propose is technically correct ... but I think we could make it easier to understand. If you agree, I was thinking something like the following:

```
 * Mappings with a colon (`:`) that is not followed by a white space are
   deprecated and will lead to a `ParseException` in Symfony 4.0 (e.g. `foo:bar`
   must be `foo: bar`).
```
