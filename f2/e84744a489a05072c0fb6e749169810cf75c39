Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.1" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "5.4, 6.4, and 7.1 for bug fixes".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

It would be great to have a test covering that case to prevent regressions.

The change is inside a private function and is based on the configuration of the environment PHPUnit is executed in.

I know some ways on how to create this test, but what would be the correct Symfony way to do this? Are there other similar tests I can adapt from?

Well, maybe it involve a test running a separate PHP process (passing a specific php.ini so that it does not depend on the config of the host running PHPUnit) using a PHP script using that PhpSubprocess class. That's already the way other PhpSubprocess tests are written.
