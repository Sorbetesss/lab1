What about removing all of them actually?

We have already released version 5.2.0 of the bridges that claim compatibility with Notifier 5.3.

I don't like them either, but imho we should not remove them before 6.0. Otherwise, we would allow Composer to make a bad decision.

Then shouldn't we specifically conflit with the only bridges that have a 5.2.0 tag?

All of the bridges listed here existed in 5.2 already. Note that for some of the bridges, the 5.1.0, 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 tags are also affected.
