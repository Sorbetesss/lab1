@javiereguiluz Can you rebase on current master? I'm wondering it we could use this new settings to automatically restrict `_locale` in URLs if no explicit requirement is set? Would that make sense?

I've rebased and added a test, but please tell me any other test that you think it may be necessary. Thanks!

I tweaked a bit the behavior of this option. It now works as follows:

```yaml
# config/packages/translation.yaml
framework:
    translator:
        # if you don't define this option or set it to null or [], all
        # catalogs are generated (same behavior as current versions)
        enabled_locales: null
        enabled_locales: []

        # if you define some values in this option, only those catalogs are generated
        enabled_locales: ['es', 'en']
```
