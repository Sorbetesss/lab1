Is browser support good enough?

Anyway, isn't it a BC break? JS apps may rely on `type="datetime"`. Not sure it is worth it.

`type="datetime"` is supported by exactly 0 browser out there, meaning checking the type DOM property gives you `text` due to the type fallback.
And the `datetime` type is removed from the HTML spec.

However, the HTML5_FORMAT constant has the timezone included in the format. So it should be updated for `datetime-local` to remove the timezone part.

Is this enough? I mean is the format in which data is sent by browsers the same as it was meant to with the old `datetime` type?

From my short test, it seems Chrome submits the `datetime-local` without a timezone. So @stof would be right that `\Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\DateTimeType::HTML5_FORMAT` needs to be changed.

Would it not be considered a BC break to change the value of a constant?

What's the status of this? Can I help?

@pierredup let's do the change as requested by @Tobion /@stof
