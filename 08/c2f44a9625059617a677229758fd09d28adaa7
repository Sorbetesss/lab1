@mpdude I made an update that refer to your comment, is it ok :) ?

:+1: for the "expect never" change.

Besides that, I wouldn't touch the cache file. How that works (and what effects it has) is an implementation detail of the `ConfigCache`. And I don't see what additional assertions this change would bring.

Maybe someone else can comment?

Disregard my previous comment – I was looking at an outdated version of the "Files changed" tab.

Sorry.
