Sorry about my last comment, but I wasn't at the computer and I couldn't explain myself. The reason I disabled the selection is that when you click the trace header to collapse/expand it, random parts of it are selected by the browser:

![expcetion-selection](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/26618403/9a3ea082-45da-11e7-9ef3-64729e630007.gif)

Is there any way to enable selecting text but disabling that undesired random selection? Thanks!

You don't need to apologize!
However, that's really weird. I tried on my own laptop, using chrome, safari and firefox, but I don't get such random selection by simply clicking on the header for collapsing (except when double-clicking, but that's the normal behavior) :/

Can someone else try on his side?

Oh, but re-considering your gif, that's indeed because you're toggling it quite fast, so it's considered a double-click by the browser.
I'd say it should not really happen in normal usage of the page. You're not likely to collapse/uncollapse everything like this. However, you're likely to need to select and copy the exception or message üòÑ

OK ... and have you tried collapsing/expanding each line of the trace? Because I remember having issues with that too: the entire line was selected and looked ugly.

In any case, üëç  from me if you have reviewed this and it works as expected.

I've just tried. Nothing to report. Maybe the issues you're talking about were more prominent and annoying in a first version of the redesigned page, but now the result is really satisfying to me :)
The only issue I still get by expanding everything is the one I suggested to fix in #22971. Sometime it  gets entirely out of my screen.

Yes, but I thought the error reported in #22971 was fixed and merged in another PR. It was the first thing some people notice with the redesign and there was a PR for that. I can't find it now.
