Wouldn't it make sense to move that deprecation into the kernel? ðŸ¤”

There are alot of deprecation with this being deprecated directly in the Kernel, I see 2 way of fixing this:
- marking all test as expecting this deprecation ( :( )
- Fixing all the test in this PR, but it seems like modify more than 90 test.

WDYT ?

is there a legit case that relies on a nulled container? We should check before shipping :)

in general i think tests should be fixed yes, unless it tests a behavior that becomes irrelevant in 5.0; then it's a legacy  test.

The deprecations seem to be triggered by the `TestContainer` that we use which calls the `getContainer()` method of the `Kernel` class even after the kernel was shut down when the `reset()` method is called.
