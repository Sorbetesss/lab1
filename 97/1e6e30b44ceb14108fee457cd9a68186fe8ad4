:+1: to remove it as done by this PR.

I would vote for deprecating the method to prevent unexpected BC breaks for users of this class.

@xabbuh Is it really worth it?

Judging by the name of the method and given the fact that people will use the `AbstractObjectNormalizer` as the base class for their own normalizers, I fear that there will be users out there who call this method before doing actual normalisation work which would then break.

Ok, fair enough. Let's add a deprecation notice then.

After a quick search, I wasn't able to find any public project using this method. Regarding the fact that it was introduced in 3.1 (only 6 months ago) and is useless, I really doubt than anybody has used it.

Maybe add a ~~changelog~~ upgrade note about the silent removal of this method. As it was forgotten before...

Imo. we can totally be pragmatic on left-over code from one minor to another. But it should be documented.

:+1: on my side for an UPGRADE entry and no deprecation.
