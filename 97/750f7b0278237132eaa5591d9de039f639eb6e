@maryo Can you add a unit test to cover this change?

Hello @maryo, can you describe the use case for this?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@romainneutron: Just because i want to display a better message to the user.

'User "John Doe" could not be found.'
instead of
'Username could not be found.'

AuthenticationException have getMessageKey() and getMessageData() methods with comment "Message data to be used by the translation component.".

These methods are not used in the framework at all. But in my case i have my own AuthenticationFailureHandler which returns JsonResponse (REST API). I use translator to translate the AuthenticationException there.

```php
$this->translator->trans($exception->getMessageKey(), $exception->getMessageData(), 'exceptions')
```

BTW i have these methods on some other exceptions too. That's why the translation domain is set to "exceptions".

Then `getMessageKey` return value should be updated. In the current implementation, there is no placeholder for `{{ username }}` variable in the message key.

@romainneutron I can add it but is it a good idea to show the username as a default behavior?... User can easily use the placeholder in translations. That was the point of the PR.

Actually I think that displaying the username by default is not a good practice. I mean, the user know what it enters, and this is probably already displayed in the form.

I agree with @fabpot here
