Running tests just for this bundle depends on #11077

I have no clues why both Travis and fabbot.io failed.

@clemens-tolboom is not your fault on travis-ci, about fabbot.io no idea

I guess due to the different structure anyone relying on the structure probably just created code that would be able to deal with both structures .. at the very least it should be an easy fix to either remove the now no longer needed version or to overwrite this template.

so +1

:+1: however: should we add a note in the CHANGELOG.md or UPGRADE.md files ?

I think the changelog is enough (this does not affect the prod environment, only the debug ones)

@clemens-tolboom Can you add a note in the CHANGELOG file of the bundle?
