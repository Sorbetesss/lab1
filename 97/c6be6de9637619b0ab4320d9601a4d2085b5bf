Supporting PHP 8 is done in patch releases (that's why Symfony 4.4 supports it). So this should be done in the lowest maintained branch containing each bridge.

Ok, than this branch seems to be correct, as they all were introduced as experimental bridges in `5.2`. Thanks for the feedback @stof üëç
