Not sure if this is considered bug fix or new feature though. Weâ€™ll see. Update to the docs also should be made.

I would consider it as a bug fix.

The XML schema needs to be updated to support multiple fallbacks too

While we are at it, what about allowing `fallbacks` as well like done for many other config items where we can have more than one items?

We should indeed have ``->arrayNode('fallbacks')`` and a ``fixXmlConfig('fallback')`` on the parent
