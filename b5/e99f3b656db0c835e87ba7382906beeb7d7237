I see. Anyways I'm glad I could help you with the research part and learnt some error handling stuff. Still have one question though, why do you return a `function that returns false` in getPhpUnitErrorHandler? isn't just `false` not enough in the set_error_handler callback?

the return value is used with `call_user_func`, returning `false` here would then break.

Nope, fabbot doesn't work for the bridge.
