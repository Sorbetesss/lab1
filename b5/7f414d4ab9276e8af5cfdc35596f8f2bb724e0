This won't help: 5.1.1 will remain installable.
But we *can* remove the `void` return type in 5.1 - that's not a BC break.

Right. I'd suggest to add conflict rules to notifier 5.2 that prevent the installation of 5.1 bridges. That should do the trick.

That won't change anything. Even without the return type, a 5.1 bridge would be incompatible because Notifier 5.2 defines a return type that cannot be removed in a child class.
