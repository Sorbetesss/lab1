Would love to get some kind of validation from @SecondeJK before merging.

Thanks for sorting this @nicolas-grekas. The baseURL for the API is still the same (i.e. rest.nexmo.com) but if this changes in the future I can raise it or issue a PR to make things smoother.

@fabpot I'm the PHP Advocate for Vonage, formerly Nexmo - the rebranding only happened recent-ishly despite the sale being quite a while back. I guess expect we'll be bothering you a lot more re: Symfony events etc. soon!
