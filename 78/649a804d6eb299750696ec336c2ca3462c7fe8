@stof looks like it fixed now, thanks . Also i don see any CHANGELOG line for this issue, you dont include it in CHANGELOG since it is minor version or what ?

@Ragazzo for bug fixes in minor versions, the changelog is updated automatically by Fabien when doing a release.

ok, i see you dont include names of developers who fixed and found those bugs and issue number, can be hard to track it down for changes .

the automatic changelog includes it: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/CHANGELOG-2.3.md (well, it includes the github username of the guy fixing the issue, not the name)
