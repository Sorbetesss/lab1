note: The tests pass, but there is an error with Travis on 5.3 build segfault.

Your link to the doc PR is wrong. It is linking to a doc issue, not to a doc PR.

@stof - does it have to be a PR rather than an issue? I thought the idea was so that a feature will not be forgotten. the eventual PR will reference that ticket. I'd prefer not to write docs until it's merged.

@stof is right: we don't merge new features anymore without proper documentation.

@fabpot - OK, that's fine. If the PR is acceptable now then I'll do the docs.

@fabpot - Documentation PR completed
