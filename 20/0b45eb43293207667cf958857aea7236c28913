Travis is hanging?

@ro0NL No, it's just that there is a lot of activity, and the queue is quite large right now :)

Monitoring travis.. and PHP7 still fails. What a day...

edit: wait.. that could actually be a deps issue.. ill have a look at composer file.

Not sure what needs to be done here;

```
# frameworkbundle composer.json
"symfony/console": "~2.8.8|~3.0.8",
```

```
# travis, PHP7, deps=high
- Installing symfony/console (3.0.x-dev 926061e): Loading from cache
```

```
# travis, PHP7.1, deps=low
- Installing symfony/console (v2.8.8): Downloading (100%)
```

@ro0NL Not sure but I'd say `~2.8.19|~3.3`

~~No, in 2.8, we cannot depend on anything else but 3.0. I think we dropped 3.0 in some cases though, so `~2.8.19` should be the way to go I suppose.~~ Actually, that's a bad idea.
