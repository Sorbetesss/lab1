No need to create a PR for 2.5. We first need to merge this one in 2.3, then 2.5. At this point, you will be able to create a PR for 2.5 for additional changes. Thanks.

I checked all files manualy and i think it's good now. Tests are passing on my debian but dunno why they are not passing on Travis.
