Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

This is ready to go! And important for 6.4. Test failures look unrelated.

Ready to go - test failures are expected (due to FWBundle not using the code from this PR)
