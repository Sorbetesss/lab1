Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.2 / 6.3".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

> Can you add a test case please?

I don't understand any of the test suite stuff...

I'm not even sure that the existing `AutowirePassTest::testAutowireAttribute()` even passes.
I don't see an `AutowireAttribute` class defined in `Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Tests/Compiler`, nor does a `use` alias exist for it.
I'm not even sure how `$this->assertCount(9, $definition->getArguments());` on a non-existent class passes...

> non-existent AutowireAttribute class

Nevermind, I found it...

Test cases submitted.
