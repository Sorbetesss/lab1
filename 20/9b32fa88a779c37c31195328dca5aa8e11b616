I added the most basic block for file_label and file_widget for overriding form-control-label, form-control-file and using custom-file-input, custom-file-label.

We try to put errors in the label to respect a standard for blind people, but I think it's difficult in this case.. Because the label is directly in the field. I look if there is a way to do it.
