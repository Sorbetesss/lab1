Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.4 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.3, 5.4, 6.0.

Cheers!

You've submitted your patch against the 5.4 branch although 5.2 should be the correct target. Can you please rebase your changes?

Furthermore, can you please add a test covering your changes?

@derrabus

The 5.2 version is no longer maintained. So consider upgrading to Symfony 5.3.
I submitted my patch against the 5.3 branch.

And , I already add a test covering my changes. Please advise thanks.

Don't this apply to `SessionLogoutHandler` as well?

Yeah, my comment did not age well. ðŸ˜… We've just release the final 5.2 release, so 5.3 is the correct target now.

Hi @mousezheng! Thanks for preparing this PR so quickly and even writing a test case.

There are some mostly aesthetic suggestions for your test. Don't worry about too much about them, each library has its own unwritten testing practices :)

@chalasr  `SessionLogoutHandler` deprecated since Symfony 5.1.  in 4.4 this may be a problem.

But that does not mean that we can leave it broken. If it needs to be fixed, we should fix it.

But we can't include the fix in this PR, as that fix should target 4.4 and not 5.3 :)
