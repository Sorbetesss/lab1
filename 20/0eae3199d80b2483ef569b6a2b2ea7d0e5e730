Honestly, I'm not a big fan of adding `void`. e.g. on test cases, they are pure visual noise.
Can you please rebase this PR, and maybe move the void return types to another PR if you want to push them forward?

Hey, I could have added `void` to all `test*` methods, but I thought that might hurt your eyes a little too much. ðŸ˜…

As I already said on #33228, I might need a llittle guidance on when to add `void`. Sometimes you add `void` yourself, sometimes you state that you don't like `void`.

:'D I did add them when a third-party dep encourages us to do so. I may have added more but I regret already :)

If you've heard someone weeping, it was probably me reverting all the `void` declarations. PR is ready now. ðŸ˜ƒ
