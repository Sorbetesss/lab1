That's for 3.4, right? Could you please add a test case also?

Yes, will redo against 3.4. The code didn't apply to both versions, so it needs a separate patch for each.

@nicolas-grekas ✔️ Now against 3.4  ✔️ Test coverage added

Had to force-push a second time to get Appveyor to rerun, as I force-pushed the first time before changing the base branch for the PR.
