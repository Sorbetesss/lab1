Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.3" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.2".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Is this bug present in Symfony 6.2 only or is 5.4 affected as well?

I think it is an S6.2 enhancement for extracting `/.*message/i` from Entity Attributes.
