@stof @fabpot I have processed the remarks. While at it, I want to add or remove the trailing `.`. In exceptions they are present, but not in all the logs. Should I remove them all or add them all? It might be a good idea to add it in this PR as no history will be lost of this change if someone decides to add them later.

Seems like a flaky test is making this build fail:
```
1) Symfony\Component\Process\Tests\SimpleProcessTest::testStopWithTimeoutIsActuallyWorking
Failed asserting that 4.0517840385437 is less than 4.
```

I would add dots everywhere (which is what we do for exception messages).

Dots added and tests updated.
