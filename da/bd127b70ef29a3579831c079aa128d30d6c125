Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.4 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

After a little more digging I've updated this PR to a slightly better fix (I think), but up to reviewers if it is.

I cannot see an easy way to test this however, does anyone have a pointer to one?

you could check eg. `*_KernelDevDebugContainerDeprecations.log` in dev cache folder for reference

for tests such file needs a mock, which doesnt exists yet AFAIK.

I'll try and write a test tomorrow then, thanks for the suggestion.

I can confirm that this issue is real, and the changes fixed it for me.
