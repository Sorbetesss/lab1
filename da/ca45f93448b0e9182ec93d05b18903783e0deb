I think most of the users are using the ORM, so having the name in the deprecation makes sense and is very helpful, I wouldn't remove it for a more generic message, which is correct, but ends up in many research for the users.

So if we are not able to get the right context, what about something like this:
```diff
- Since symfony/doctrine-bridge 6.3: Registering "Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Tests\MySubscriber" as a Doctrine subscriber is deprecated. Register it as a listener instead, using e.g. the #[AsDoctrineListener] attribute.
+ Since symfony/doctrine-bridge 6.3: Registering "Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Tests\MySubscriber" as a Doctrine subscriber is deprecated. Register it as a listener instead, using e.g. the #[AsDoctrineListener] or #[AsDocumentListener] attribute.
```
