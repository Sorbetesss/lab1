The PR conflicts a bit with upstream, during added constructor hints. Let me know what to do, i wasnt necessarily aiming to deprecate not passing this new argument, nor do i want to add a new setter.

Also im not sure about applying all short array changes here&now, on 3.4

edit: dropped the constructor arg, but still conflicts :)
