Related; should we patch [`isEnabled`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/WebServerBundle/Command/ServerLogCommand.php#L36) as well? If you load the webserverbundle based on a symfony/symfony project the CLI app crashes due a missing FormatterInterface from monolog/monolog.

I'm personally :-1: on adding more `suggest`ions in `composer.json`. I don't see how it adds value as I don't see why people would read those suggestions when installing a new dependency. That's more something for the docs.

@ro0NL Well seen! I added this one.

@fabpot Indeed, these suggestions must appear in the documentation; however, I think suggestions' composer must match with the documentation. Personally, I sometimes launch  `composer suggest -v` for discover the suggestions.
