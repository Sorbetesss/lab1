We need to be careful here, type=number is increasingly seen as providing bad UX.

Thats' a good point, and actually it is specified in the norm that they should not be used for non-sequential inputs (ie., bank account numbers...). Maybe it would be worth a warning in `NumberType` documentation?

Fortunately here with monetary amounts & percentages we should be safe, there are legit use cases.

Thanks you for the heads up, I rebased code & updated `CHANGELOG.md`
I will work on a PR for documentation tomorrow.

Fabbot and Travis are green, AppVeyor failed because of a quota. If someone can please restart it, it should pass.

What's the status of this PR?

For me, the code part was done. I was waiting for some "formal" approval before doing the doc update.
Everything can be over pretty quickly, I think that addition is still relevant
