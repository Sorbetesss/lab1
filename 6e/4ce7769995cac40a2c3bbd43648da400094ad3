@wouterj I understand your POV, however to me it brings value in code readability but also reliability since match is a strict comparison. But you obviously know better than me if it's worth it as I don't realize the impact of the increased maintenance.

If that's ok with you I'll let other core members confirm your stance and make the appropriate modifications. Thanks.

Personally I find the code more readable when using match. The change is fine to me.
