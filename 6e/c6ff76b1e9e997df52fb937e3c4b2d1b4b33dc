Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "7.2 for features / 5.4, 6.4, 7.0, and 7.1 for bug fixes".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Thank you for your PR. However, we do not accept code-style changes on LTS branches, which is why I'm retargeting your PR to the 7.2 branch.

Is this actually optimizing something ?

I don't think so, this is just CS cleanup.

then the PR description is misleading

I am ðŸ‘Ž on merging this, it is just syntax sugar to me
