What happens if `attributesMetadata` has an entry only for a different attribute ? `null === $maxDepth = $attributesMetadata[$attribute]?->getMaxDepth()` would still trigger a warning in such case.

To me, the right fix would be handle properly the case where there is no `$attribute` key in the array.

Regarding the test failure, I'm not sure why that Redis test is failing now, perhaps something in the dependencies updated?

I removed my fix and ran just that test, fails with or without my fix in place, so don't believe it's a result of the change to this PR.
