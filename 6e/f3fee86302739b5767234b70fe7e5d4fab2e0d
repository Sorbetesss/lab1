Thank you for telling us about this.
Could you please target branch 3.4 and add a test case also?

Any news? fabbot has also some fixes for you.

@nicolas-grekas I tried changing the base, but looks like 3.4 does not have that file. I'll be creating some test cases today and apply patches from fabbot as mentioned by @fabpot

NVM realized it is just on another place. I'll be doing the change in a bit.

@nicolas-grekas I have encountered 2 issues with my PR and would like to ask for suggestions.
on PHP 5.6 there is an issue that docx and xml files are actually reported as application/zip as they are not being recognized.
And looks like TravisCi is not running php 7.4 where this issue is present.

I'd suggest skipping the test on PHP5 by adding an `@requires PHP 7 annotation on the test case.
PHP 7.4 runs on the deps=low job.
