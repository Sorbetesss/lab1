Performing a quick test directly within the component's source directory shows that the exception is indeed only thrown when psr/simple-cache 3.0 is installed:

This does not prevent the installation of the conflicting version as I originally hoped (and thus the oddly-named feature branch here), but it at least provides a clear explanation of what's wrong and how to correct it, which is good enough for me and my library's users :)
