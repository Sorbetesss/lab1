@yceruto @Tobion @stof thank you for all the reviews. I took a bit too much liberty in trying to get all service definitions working with autowiring because I really love the power of that feature. Did revert that now and handled the rest of all comments. I think this PR is according to standards and ready to go now.

Let me know when the time is there to enable autowiring all over the place, I'm then happy to help!

@rvanlaak working "with" autowiring is already the case. What you did is making them *use* autowiring. And the decision is to use explicit wiring in core, to reduce the risk of messing things if people redefine autowiring aliases in a weird way.

the failing tests on Appveyor do not seem related?
