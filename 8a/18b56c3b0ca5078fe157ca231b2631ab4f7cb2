Adding `final` is a BC break.

All places where you changed ``is_array`` checks to casting are changing the behavior of the code

I reverted array casting and design patterns related changes, so basically it's left just minor changes.
Thank you all for your comments and links. That's hard work to support BC and huge thanks for that.

PS: Theoretically, could "finals" be deployed for utility classes in Symfony 3?

@unkind : it is, and reverted already. Thank you for feedback!
