You can already see the FQCN when you move your mouse cursor over the class short name (thanks to the `title` HTML attr), so not sure it's really needed. Most of the time you know the class you are dumping.

@fancyweb Yes We can able to see the title, could you able to copy that? ( you may need to inspect the element to copy that ) and sometime we are not sure about class we dumping ( eg: think about external libraries ), please advice me feather.

Thanks.
