@fabpot I've fixed comments from code review. Now working on adding tests (I've updated TODO list in PR header)

I've fixed tests and removed BC-breaks, so bc-break label non-actual anymore. More tests for all factories should be added, but I need 1 week more due to vacation.

BTW PR is ready for another round of review.

Not sure if this PR is ready now but fabbot has an interesting patch to apply.

Almost ready. Failure caused because #32553 not merged yet.

Finally PR is ready ðŸŽ‰

Travis is green except `deps=high` (because master hasn't this PR yet). To be honest I still haven't performed manual testing of the branch, but we already have test for DI extension and each factory properly tested.
