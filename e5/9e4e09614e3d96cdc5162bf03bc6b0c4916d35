@nicolas-grekas see the last paragraph.

Works either for 4.2 or 4.1 to me. 4.2 feels more natural since it's almost a "new feature". Also because projects that are on 4.1 either already moved to deprecation-less - or can skip 4.1 altogether. Makes sense?

@nicolas-grekas if 4.1 keeps that deprecation, community bundles wanting to support both the 3.4 LTS and 4.1 (current stable) still have to pay the cost.

And no, shared bundles have not all moved to be deprecation-free in their released versions, as there is no easy way for that.
