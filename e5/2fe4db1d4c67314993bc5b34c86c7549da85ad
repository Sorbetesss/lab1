IMHO, would be better to keep testGetClientIp and make a new one for testGetClientIps probably using a new dataprovider, actual one is already complex enough. what do you think ?

I started to implement the tests like this (separate test/data provider for getClientIps), but the code of the test itself would be exactly the same as the one for getClientIp (except for the method call). So I think it's better to use data providers in this case.

@gnutix I would keep 2 spearate data provider and extract the common Request building to a private method used in both tests instead.
Mixing the tests of both methods in the same data provider is not readable

@stof Fixed in last commit ! Thanks for your input.

Nothing really related to that pull request, but there's a scrutinizer comment about two classes in RequestTest.php. Could I fix it along the way, or should I create a separate pull request ?

@gnutix it should be done in a separate PR, but not sure it is really necessary in that case.

Is there anything else I might do for this PR to get merged ? :)
