IMO you should remove all references about `BaseException` because no longer exists if the RFC is accepted.

@dosten, I think ```BaseException``` should be kept since this change is only intended to add compatibility with PHP 7 and not to drop compatibility with PHP 5.

@phansys The `BaseException` has been implemented in 7.0 see https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_exceptions_for_php7 and as you can see in php/php-src#1284: "There is no common exception class anymore, only the Throwable interface. BaseException or any similar class has been eliminated."

Oh, you're right @dosten, I agree with you.

What do @symfony/deciders think? Should we keep BaseException compatibility?
That doesn't cost very much, and php7-alpha1 is tagged with them.
Strictly following our BC promise, we should keep supporting them, thus the current state of this PR.

@nicolas-grekas we don't advocate PHP 7 compat yet, and this would only be about compat with an early alpha release. So IMO, it is fine to drop the code handling the early PHP 7 implementation.

but anyway, we should wait until the PHP 7 codebase is updated before merging this PR

I agree that we should not be keeping compat with an alpha version of PHP7.

Agree with stof and fabpot

The Throwable Interface RFC has been accepted, this PR is ready for vote @symfony/deciders
