@julienfalque Can you check if this change solves the issue you described in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21083#issuecomment-269696733 too?

This currently breaks the handling of the exit code (see var $exit). Otherwise I think that's a good way to go. Maybe see if we can do something with OK/KO in a shutdown function ? Or deal with it in .travis.yml file as it was done before.

Unfortunately, we cannot detect the exit code inside a shutdown function. So we will need to update our Travis CI config after this has been merged.
