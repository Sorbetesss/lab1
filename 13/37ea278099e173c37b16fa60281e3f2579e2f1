> Not a bug per se though, I'd say this should be merged in 6.2.

I couldn't decide initially if it should be suggested as a bug or feature, but it looks more like an improvement. Do you think I should create another PR for 6.2 too?

I think it has been said that merges to older tags would be merged to newer ones in a few days.

No worry, we can switch the branch while merging this PR.
