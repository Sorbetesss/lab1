Someone proposed to fail when a var was used, but not provided when calling. Is that something that would be possible?

I need to figure out, but I don't see anything that would make it not possible.

@Simperfit FYI I just pushed some changes here. I added two brackets around placeholders, to make it more twig-like. I also removed the condition that every env has to have a corresponding param (but kept the reciprocal: param must have an env param). I also restricted this feature to commandine strings, which are the only one that should have any parsing, like the shell does already.

Could you please update the main description of this PR as a short README of the feature, so that the doc team and other people can know what this is about? Doc PR welcome also of course.

Thanks @nicolas-grekas I'm going to write the doc PR following this one.
