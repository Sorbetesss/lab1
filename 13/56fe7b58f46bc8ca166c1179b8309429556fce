Should we tell about any corresponding deprecation in UPGRADE-3.4.md also?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not sure why you would to upgrade 3.4 also but to me it's pretty fine to enhance the upgrade document only for 4.0

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This should be merged on branch 3.4, where we advertise for changes needed to prepare for 4.0.
I'm surprised there is no corresponding changes on UPGRADE-3.4.md. Could anyone have a look?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, following the link in the description gives the answer: the depreciation should be advertised in UPGRADE-3.4.md for sure.

I'm still not sure as this is deprecated since 3.4 so I should not care *unless* upgrading to 4.
However if that's the practice followed here, I'll be happy to change the base of this PR, _just let me know_.
After this I'll change what @iltar reviewed in order to make the docs consistent.

I do confirm this should be on 3.4 :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@nicolas-grekas I've changed the PR base branch
@iltar I've fixed what you've requested

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you @DonCallisto
Can you please also update UPGRADE-3.4.md?
I invite you to compare both files (4.0 and 3.4) to figure out what I'm talking about since my first comment :)

And `src/Symfony/Component/Security/CHANGELOG.md` also should be updated BTW!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DonCallisto at 2018-05-30T10:02:38Z

Ok, thank you for this advices. I'll take a look at them ASAP.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DonCallisto at 2018-05-30T11:15:03Z

@nicolas-grekas updated. Please check if fits well and let me know if anything else has to be changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DonCallisto at 2018-05-30T12:06:58Z

Now it's hopefully fine
