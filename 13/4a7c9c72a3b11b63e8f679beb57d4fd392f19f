Possible BC break, see the test: https://github.com/sergeyfedotov/symfony-form/blob/8647aac0e7648252de197021f46e5c4d69a97dba/Tests/Extension/Core/Type/CollectionTypeTest.php#L337

@sergeyfedotov The assertion in your last test looks wrong, "prototype" should not be required in that case, and the test is passing while it's not as expected. I don't think there is a BC break here.

Ok. I really don't know should it be interpreted as a BC break or not. But currently `entry_options` overrides the prototype options and this PR changes the behaviour.

Seems like this line https://github.com/HeahDude/symfony/blob/bug-prototype_required/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Core/Type/CollectionType.php#L31 is not needed anymore.

@sergeyfedotov Yes it is, if the parent does not override the prototype options, `entry_options` should do it.

Note to the merger: in 2.8 `options` option in the two tests added needs to be renamed `entry_options`. Thanks
