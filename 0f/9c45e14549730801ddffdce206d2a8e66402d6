Symfony 3.1 is not maintained anymore :wink: I guess the lowest maintained affected branch is 3.4? Before that there is no PSR-6 Cache.

But I think its fine to target even 2.7 for consistency? I would wait for a symfony member to confirm :wink:

@dmaicher : Sorry. Too worried to not forget a comment, to find the right way to create patchs and I forgot the most important : the bug... ðŸ˜„
Thanks for your comments
