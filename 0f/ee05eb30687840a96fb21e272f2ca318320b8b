Apparently, SetupPHP installs some dev snapshot of `ext-edis` on PHP 8.1. I don't know why they do that since the stable 5.3.4 works fine on PHP 8.1. This PR fixes all the tests I could fix. Regarding the remaining failures, I believe that the extension is simply broken.

I've pinned the redis extension to get green tests again.
