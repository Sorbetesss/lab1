This solution ruins the fields hierarchy in form errors and returns `[field1].data` instead of `children[field1].data`.

And it does not meet all of the sequence of groups requirements (e.g., when all the groups included in each array are validated). As it described here from `The second point is...`: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/35556#discussion_r379300743

Can you provide a failing test case for what you have in mind?

There is a file with tests for that (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/35556/files, `FormTypeValidatorExtensionTest.php`):
`FormTypeValidatorExtensionTest::testGroupSequenceWithConstraintsOptionMatrix`
`FormTypeValidatorExtensionTest::provideGroupsSequenceAndResultData`

All tests will fail because of `children[...].data`.
And also two with sequence `[['First', 'Second'], 'Third']`

Thanks @greedyivan for the review, I've add a test to cover nested array groups in sequence and push some fixes in 9aa6963.

All tests from my PR passed.
