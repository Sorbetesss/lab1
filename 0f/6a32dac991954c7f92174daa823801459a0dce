@xabbuh Turns out we should do the same in the twig template for foundation 5. However since it is not present in 2.7 I can't include the change in this PR. Should I open a second one?

@enumag Would be great if you were able to do that. :+1:

@Tobion You mean to prefix the commit message with "bug #12050" or something else?

No that was just for anyone reviewing the code
