FYI, you can get a cleaner diff on Github by appending the `w=1` query param to the url to ignore whitespaces: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21754/files?w=1 ðŸ˜‰

does this apply on a lower supported branch? (2.7, 2.8 or 3.2?) that'd help reduce future merge conflicts.

@nicolas-grekas Sure. I haven't done it because I thought we are supposed to submit only bugfixes against lower versions. Want me to submit new PR?

no need to create a new PR, you can rebase your branch and change the base branch of the PR (see "Edit" button near title)

Rebased onto 3.2. Older are conflicting.

I looked at it, that applies to 2.7 - of course it conflicts - but that is easily resolved :)

and we should indeed apply it on 2.7. It is better to have a conflict once (to propagate the reduced nesting to all branches) than to have it for all future bug fixes in this code.
