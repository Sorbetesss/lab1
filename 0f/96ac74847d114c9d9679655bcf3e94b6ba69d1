We cannot deprecate something in 5.2 as it's a maintenance branch, it should be done on 5.x.
For 5.2, the breaking change made to `Helper::strlen()` should probably be reverted

Thank you. I was hesitant about this.

Are we okey with reverting https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/40524, adding that PR as a feature to 5.x and then merge this PR in 5.x?
