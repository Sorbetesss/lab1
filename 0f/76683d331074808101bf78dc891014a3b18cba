What about the other occurrences? There's a total of 6 references to symfony2 in the master atm. https://github.com/symfony/symfony/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=symfony2 Might as well take those along while at it ^^

As pointed out by @iltar, ~~the tests corresponding to the classes changed here must be updated~~ (they are already) the `AbstractSurrogate` class too.

The other occurrences being `src/Symfony/Component/BrowserKit/Client.php` and two tests (`src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/Tests/Extension/StopwatchExtensionTest.php` and `src/Symfony/Component/BrowserKit/Tests/ClientTest.php`) I think they could be fixed here btw.

@iltar, @chalasr, thank you for your comments.
Originally I debugged ESI, found this surrogate capability with 'symfony2' and decided to update it.
However, I agree that it make sense to eliminate all 'symfony2' mentions.

I've done that and changed both PR name and description.
Could you have a look please?

@a-ast Can you rebase this PR and squash your commits? Thanks.

I've updated CHANGELOG/UPGRADE files with information about the BrowserKit user agent change.
Rebased, squashed.
Should I mark my changes in CHANGELOGs with [BC BREAK] labels?

LGTM as is
