@nicolas-grekas tests are failling because I changed the usage directly in this PR maybe I should do 2 PR ? removed the event  and then change the usage ?

The events test has been fixed, still missing the resolution of https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/31672#discussion_r290758431 and the some kernel.root_dir test are broken, this needs to be looked at to maybe raise the dependencies.

To me, the events part should be split in its own PR.
