There is a missing translation in `https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Resources/translations/validators.sr_Cyrl.xlf` (the last one, id 100, which you can find here for English: `https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Resources/translations/validators.en.xlf`).

Ah, I see what happened, I did not fetch upstream ...
Thank you @fabpot, should be good now.
