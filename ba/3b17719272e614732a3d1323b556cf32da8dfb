Status: needs work
Reason: tests are not actually running and it's only running PHP 7.2 for now

you should avoid it being marked as an intermediary version though. You don't want it to be skipped.

@stof do you think we should prevent 7.2 to be marked as intermediate for all the PRs or it was just in the context of my debugging?

@nicolas-grekas as discussed, kept here only the process test change and travis configuration and moved the native session storage PR to https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/24531 to target 2.7.

And rebased. Tests are logically still failing because of the HttpFoundation bug fixed in #24531.
