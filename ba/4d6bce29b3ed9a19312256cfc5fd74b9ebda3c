Updated this PR:

 * A new `ConsoleErrorEvent` was introduced, replacing `ConsoleExceptionEvent`. This now adds full PHP 7 support (`\Throwable` instead of `\Exception`) and makes it a lot easier to trigger deprecation notices.
 * Instead of passing `null` to `setException()`, `markErrorAsHandled()` and `isErrorHandled()` were introduced.
 * Tests were updated to use the new event and a new legacy test was added for the old behaviour.

*Fabbot.io failures should be ignored, this is a bug in the CS fixer config*

So, what's the decision here:

 1. Keep current proposal, using `$event->markErrorAsHandled()` to indicate console shouldn't output the error
 1. Change to `$event->setException(null)` again

I'm getting a bit tired of rebasing my PRs each month, so I would like to have some quick decision making on this. Happy to close as well.
