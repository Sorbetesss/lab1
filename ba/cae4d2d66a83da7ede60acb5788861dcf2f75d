> But we should consider not using a table here.

I agree. I'm the one who introduced the table layout in #20887 for the bootstrap 3 layout in order to provide a good-enough default output for this type. At the time, bootstrap 3 wasn't offering much (AFAIK) for displaying such a heavy type and my guess is that the base theme is overridden for most accessibility needs.
However, bootstrap 4 is now offering [form grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#form-grid) with [`col-auto` sizing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#auto-sizing) which may have suited better ðŸ˜•

As we are still doing fundamental changes to the Bootstrap 4 integration, wouldn't it be better to remove usage of tables as indicated by @ogizanagi?

Thank you @ogizanagi for clearing this out. I did not know why we are using a table.

@fabpot: Yes, we are still doing changes to the Bootstrap 4 theme. I will be done within a few (2-3) weeks. I suggest to "release" Bootstrap 4 theme with 4.1.

I agree with you both. I think we should redo this without tables. I'll update the PR today
