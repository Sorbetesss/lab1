does the anchor still work as expected ? ie anchoring to line 100 should create a top screen margin so that L100 is not hidden on the top of the screen, but has some offset before

you're right. Not sure what the quirk is but it needs to be a block element indeed.

Using `inline-block` fixes both the overlap as preserving top offset:

For `/_profiler/open?file=src/Controller/MainController.php&line=9#line9`.

But now there's this random space in both chrome and firefox:

Guess it's comes from a line break in source:

Can have a look at that.. but maybe some real CSS expert knows a better fix.
