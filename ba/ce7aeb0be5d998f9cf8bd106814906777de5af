You also need to change the sprintf format `'%s-%s-%s %s:%s:%s %s'` which is not correct anymore.

The PHP bug seems true: http://3v4l.org/Q1lpe

I guess it's because this timezone is not meant to be used anymore: http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.others.php
> Warning
Please do not use any of the timezones listed here (besides UTC), they only exist for backward compatible reasons.

But I think the change here makes sense anyway. When there is a timezone parameter we should use it instead of letting it being parsed from the string.

@Tobion fixed sprintf format as well

@Tobion not sure exactly, but probably outputTimezone could be empty sometimes - should I add check if its valid timezone?

It cannot be empty because it uses the default timezone if none is provided: https://github.com/zhil/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Core/DataTransformer/BaseDateTimeTransformer.php#L51
So you don't need to check it (an invalid one would fail before as well).
