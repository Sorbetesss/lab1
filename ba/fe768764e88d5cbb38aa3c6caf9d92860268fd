This is a new feature and must target 7.2 branch please

Thanks for your quick answer, but isn't this more of a bug fix, since `Email` methods like `replyTo` or `priority` are currently ignored with this bridge, when they shouldn't be?

One could discuss, as the bridge ignores them now, it is some kind of behavior change and we are always very careful with merging such things.
From my side a new feature, but open for a bugfix. Let's see what other members say ðŸ˜Ž

Without a doubt, this is a new feature (as it introduces a new behavior).
But as the `Reply-To` header is important, I'm going to merge it as a bug fix.
