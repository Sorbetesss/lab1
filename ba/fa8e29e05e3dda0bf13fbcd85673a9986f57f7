Not sure on this one.. but shouldn't we consider trailing slash normalization since the router, AFAIK, has some issues with it (#18702)

Minor issue, but there is a type in the test name: ('That' --> 'Than')

`public function testRefererWithoutParametersHasToBeDifferentThatLoginUrl()`

should be:

`public function testRefererWithoutParametersHasToBeDifferentThanLoginUrl()`

@cdesign Thanks! Fixed. Fixed the original test name too.

@sstok thanks for taking the time to look at this.

@ro0NL Not very sure how to apply that detection as it is kind of "quirk" of the Router, any pointers? I'd be happy to actually code them.

@mrzard i think it's a problem we cant fix.. as we cant determine the `login_path` route supports both variants yes or no. Currently how i understand it, it only is supported for imported routes.

I foresee some nasty side effects, but im not sure as i havent tested it, i.e. it needs to be reproduced first to properly document what no to do :-)
