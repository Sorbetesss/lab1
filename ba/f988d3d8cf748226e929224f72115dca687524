Is loading the resources immediately in the constructor ([here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Translation/Translator.php#L68,L70)) really necessary (why)? Commenting it out does at least not break tests.

@fabot / @nicolas-grekas does this look sensible? If you basically agree, I probably should rebase it onto 2.7.

Rebased onto 2.7; no modifications were necessary
