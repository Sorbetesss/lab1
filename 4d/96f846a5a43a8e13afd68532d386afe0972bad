Yes! I agree, I'm not really proud of it !

This class is instantiated in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/12f8faefd0cf539c3cecbdc375f87605c96a4376/src/Symfony/Component/Config/ConfigCache.php#L40 when symfony is in debug mode

and `ConfigCache` is instantiated in many different location (config, kernel, and routing component).

So I guess we may find a way to share it, but the code will be even uglier
