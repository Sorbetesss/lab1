:+1: @1ed thanks for fixing this annoying problem!

By the way, if I recall it correctly, `/_wdt/*` Ajax calls shouldn't appear in that table (and indeed, in the first versions of the toolbar they didn't appear). If this is true, we should create a separate issue to fix that issue.

Sorry this should go into 2.6 instead of 2.7.
