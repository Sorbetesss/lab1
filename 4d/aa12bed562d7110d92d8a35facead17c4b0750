I agree with you! I wasn't a big fan of the current render. I updated the description with this screenshot, looks nice!

Not sure of `(no type)`, but I couldn't come up with another wording for now

I pushed a revision containing the following changes (see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/f73c776c1ad8add7b96f1ca557e7b2ff5d43b144..68c9ae6d3c1bd6f03fa185e144ae6e5f31fedafe):
- Check for color support to display italic
- Use `~` to identify a virtual property (for the record, this character is already used with `Caster::PREFIX_VIRTUAL`)
- Added a few tests for CliDumper and HtmlDumper
- Description updated :framed_picture:

Thank you for helping me fix the implementation!
