Should we rely on `ReflectionExtractor` only for this test?

Hey!

I think @TimoBakx has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

@nicolas-grekas Ping on this one, still happens in production for us every now and then - let's get this reviewed and possibly merged.

Looks reasonable to me (should be done on 5.3 instead of 5.4 though).
