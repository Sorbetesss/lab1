Can you check the padding/marging of the link and code tag?

This is how it looks on Chrome:

Maybe we should add a new style for them.

Sorry for not checking the layout - I didn't expect any weird CSS rules ;-)

That's how it looks now (Firefox):

I'd like to keep `kernel.debug`, since that's the name of the parameter used on the linked page.

im for "debug mode", the parameter name is an implementation detail. The link explains "debug mode"  perfectly fine.

I'm using the `kernel.` part for disambiguation. After all, I confused this "debug mode" with some other debug mode myself yesterday - as *you* told me: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/13772#issuecomment-640264394

@ThomasLandauer I agree with Roland. We usually refer to this as either "debug mode" or "kernel.debug container parameter" ... but "kernel.debug mode" looks like a mix of both and I'm not sure is consistent with the rest of Symfony Docs.

Well, 2:1 against me ;-)
There you go.
