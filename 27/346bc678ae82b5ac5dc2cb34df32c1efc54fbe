Should it target version `5.4` actually?

Not sure, for me this is a feature and should target 7.1

@nicolas-grekas @fabpot please decide

Changing the type of thrown exceptions is not a bug fix so that's for 7.1 to me.

@nicolas-grekas I think it should have been handled since the beginning because it's an unserialization issue that currently ends with generic kind of exception instead of `MessageDecodingFailedException`.

I think I do not understand what's the BC break or added functionality here. For me that's a better error handling logic.

Anyway I will let you know when it's ready for 7.1 üëç

If you can explain me further why it's not bugfix I would be glad üòä

Any chance to get some new feedbacks based on my last comment before rebasing?

@nicolas-grekas @OskarStark thanks for the review, It's ready for 5.4 :+1:

Let me know for any other updates that should be performed.
