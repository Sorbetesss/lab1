Is that the only one in the full code base? Can you have a look please?

@nicolas-grekas I've updated the PR! For now I only focussed on the form component as this is my first contribution to an open source project ever ðŸ˜€

Thanks :)
Please check all components, there's no hurry so you can take your time and we'll help review!

@nicolas-grekas I've checked all components and updated the PR! But I now see that Travis CI for PHP: 7.2 and 7.3 is failing with out of memory errors. Rerunning doesn't fix the problem. Do you have an idea?
