All tests failures seems unrelated, and seem happen in conjunction with some Doctrine ORM versions.

@nicolas-grekas @yceruto all done, thanks for the review.

Same unrelated failures again in `Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Tests\ManagerRegistryTest`.

> small rebase needed

Did it, CI failures are still related to doctrine.

@nicolas-grekas Will this be merged? I need to know in order to continue experimenting/proposing new features for the messenger.

I'd like to wait a bit in case anyone else would like to review, but eventually I think it should be merged yes.

@nicolas-grekas in the meantime, I'd like to have your global impressions about https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/57536 if you can find a few minutes for it.

> The attributes are retrieved at runtime. As questioned in [#41179 (comment)](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/41179#discussion_r830053607), is this a problem?

I don't think so, reflection is fast and it probably will be insignificant compared to the command execution itself.

EDIT: here we are at dispatch, so it actually will not be executed, yet it is still way faster than the database insert that will be issued if the transport is doctrine-based, or anyother tcp round-trip if it is another type of broker.

I think this also but wanted to confirm.
