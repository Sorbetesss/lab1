we should probably do that in 2.3 instead, no?

@fabpot please merge https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/9841 so i can rebase https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/9830 and send the PR to master in which there is a new class that needs to be affected.

@fabpot thanks, now i will wait for you to upper port the 2.3 changes to master so i can rebase and then this can be submitted

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by cordoval at 2013-12-22T15:45:16Z

although actually i can just submit it now since they are non conflicting
