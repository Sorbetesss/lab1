Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.2".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

It would be nice to have a job that assert that no `.php` file is executable.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Find executable PHP files
files=$(find . -name "*.php" -type f -perm /u+x,g+x,o+x)

# Check if any executable files were found
if [ -n "$files" ]; then
    echo "Executable PHP files found:"
    echo "$files"
    exit 1
else
    echo "No executable PHP files found."
    exit 0
fi

```
