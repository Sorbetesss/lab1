While you are at it, the `@return` on `parse` is wrong as well. It must be `@return int|float|false`

When merging in 3.0 the `@see https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=59597 Bug #59597` should be removed as the bug is not relevant in the 3.x PHP versions. Maybe it's easiest the remove this `@see` directly here and thus merged upwards as the bug is already referenced in the code.
