@fabpot The license header in the `src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/HttpCache/HttpCache.php` file is somewhat special. Anything I can do to make `fabbot` happy?

@mpdude No, just keep it like it is.

But doesn't this now always violate the "The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response." part?

@xabbuh â€“ not sure what you mean. That no body should be returned? There's code elsewhere (can figure it out if you like) that will remove the body for `HEAD` requests. Until then, we need it to determine `Content-Length`.

Does that answer your question?
