I still don't get why we should make such changes. It would make impossible/very hard to support all Symfony versions in Silex for instance.

@fabpot because we have these comments that say: `RequestStack will become required in 3.0.`, which implies that it is moved as first arguments.
For Silex, you could simply check the `Kernel::VERSION_ID` consts don't you think?
