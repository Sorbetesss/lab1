I can try :nerd_face:
But I'll need probably some feedback on this.

Also digging a bit further in this I found though 33e6af5850ce167ddef96c467cd86b9a6f986f2c was the commit that introduced the offending _line_ it was actually just the result of refactorings and code style fixes and the problem was introduced in c71dfb96737ed3d79b664dcc2138a1c3929354c0. Looking at that commit it definitely smells like a copy&paste mistake.
