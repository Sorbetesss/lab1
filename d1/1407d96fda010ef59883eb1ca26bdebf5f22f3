The right source in CssToInlineStyles is rather https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/CssToInlineStyles/issues/237, which discusses the issue you fix here.

I mentioned the other issue as it claimed that the initially broken fix was taken from the Symfony source code which led me to search for it.

But that does not explain why you do this change here as the issue you link does mention any issue with the code taken from Symfony...
