I don't feel that this information should be added to the interface, but to the actual implementation in the `EventDispatcher` class instead. Adding this information to the interface adds a new requirement to fullfil for third-party implementation of the interface which should be considered a BC break.

Ok @xabbuh I didn't thought about that :-).
Let me add The information to the `EventDispatcher` instead.

@xabbuh done, tell me if you have other observations :-).

@xabbuh this is already a requirement today actually. The code already relies on listeners being sorted (the TraceableeventDispatcher would dispatch in the wrong order in case the inner dispatcher does not return them sorted for instance). So it is already a requirement of the interface

@stof ok, I was not sure about it so It has to go on the interface.

@stof @xabbuh done

@stof Then it must indeed be added to the interface itself.

Sorry for the confusion @dupuchba.

@xabbuh no problem, your feedback was still valuable.
