See https://github.com/symfony/recipes/pull/272 for a corresponding recipe (verified locally.)

Note that it would be great to deprecate using the `locator` at all in `supports()`, but 3.4 is now closed for deprecations, so should/could happen on master only.

Can you add some tests for that?

This one makes is difficult (read impossible) to have a config that works on 3.3 and 3.4/4.0 (cf. the changed recipe).

The current config that works will continue to work. I'm now rebasing on 3.3 as bug fix, so that Flex+3.3 can get the good DX config.
