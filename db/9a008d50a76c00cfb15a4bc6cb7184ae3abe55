Good catch. I think it should still try to parse both at once, if possible. So :+1: for this approach.

Do we have a test which ensures that the name will be guessed properly if it isn't already set when `getNamespace()` is called?

@xabbuh : We don't. I've just added one, thanks (ideally those tests should be backported to lower branches I guess).
