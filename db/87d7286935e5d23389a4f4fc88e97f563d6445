> Am I missing something, or are the 2 src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Tests/Authentication/Token/Fixtures/switch-user-token-*.txt files not used?

Only one of two, actually! It's used in SwitchUserListenerTest.

Thanks for the review Wouter, all fixed.

Are the broken tests related to the changes here?

@fabpot yes but only deps=high fails, I think it will be fixed once merged.
In case I'm wrong, be sure that I'll send a PR to fix it right away.
