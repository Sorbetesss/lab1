Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.0.

Cheers!

Great. Thank you for this PR and the references in #42227.

Note that `MongoDbSessionHandler` also exists in 4.4. Question for other maintainers: Is it best to send a new PR to 4.4 that fixes this issue in `MongoDbSessionHandler`? Then modify this PR to only make changes in the `MongoDbStore`?
