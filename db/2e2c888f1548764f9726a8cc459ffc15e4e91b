Any update about this one ? Should it rather be considered as a new feature as this implementation is missing since the introduction of the yaml dumper ?

As the test is marked as skipped by mentioning specifically that this is not supported, I would say that this is indeed a new feature that needs to be merged in master.

Can you update the PR accordingly? Thanks.

@fabpot : PR description updated, branch rebased and target changed. Thanks for your answer :)

I guess #19480 may be considered the same way ?
Then, I'll update the PR once this one is merged in order to resolve conflicts.
