@nicolas-grekas do you think it should go in 2.8? It is fine for me either way.

@dunglas's comment on the issue is interesting; it was done for performance reasons. This change makes sense but can we check that performance is still ok?

@fabpot that's why there is a cache layer, i don't think it's relevant.
