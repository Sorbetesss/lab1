Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 7.1 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.4 and probably newer".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

@sroze @nicolas-grekas I don't know how to test this change, since currently `queue()` is not tested anyway (or I don't see it). As described in #53944 this is rather safe and straightforward fix, since all the `$queueConfig` usages after fetching `$this->queuesOptions[$queueName]` are null-safe (`$queueConfig['flags'] ?? \AMQP_DURABLE`, `if(isset($queueConfig['arguments']))`.

This change fixes our future problem because we have custom error handler which throws exceptions on such warnings, and currently we can't properly run workers based on Messenger because it would fail on this warning.  We're on PoC stage, using Symfony's error handler in `bin/console` but before going fully with new consumer approach we need to introduce our custom error handler there, so errors in CLI are reported properly as in other places of the app. So this little change is a blocker for us ðŸ˜….

PS. CI failures seem to be unrelated?
