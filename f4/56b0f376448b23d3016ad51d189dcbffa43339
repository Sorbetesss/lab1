Rebase needed (we don't merge PRs when they contain merge commit)

Tests are failing on Form Component which I did not change. Is it a known issue?

We will also need to update the `UPGRADE-3.4.md` (explain that implementing the interface without the added method is deprecated) and `UPGRADE-4.0.md` (mention the added method) files.

Twig and VarDumper failure don't seem to be related to my PR. Are failures expected?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Twig failure should be fixable by rebasing on the latest `3.4` branch and the VarDumper tests are currently failing on the `3.4` branch too.

Moving to 4.1 as 3.4 is now in beta, thus closed for new feats.

Failures do not seem linked to my changes.

Rebased after merge of deprecation and removal of `TreeBuilder::$builder`

@bburnichon please rebase: we don't merge PR with merge commits.

Sorry I did update via github interface.

I like this feature, but I wonder if *"path separator"* is the best name for this option. Path is strongly related to "file paths". Maybe "name separator" or "key separator" or "children separator" etc.

@javiereguiluz "path" is the correct term, already used a lot in the component:
```
$ grep path src/Symfony/Component/Config/ -ri | wc -l
219
```
