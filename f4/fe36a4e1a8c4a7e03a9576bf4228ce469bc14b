This needs to be done on a per case basis? Ie. `case $question instanceof ChoiceQuestion:` requires a different approach right?

edit: consider https://github.com/chalasr/symfony/blob/84779a1b4cde11a83ec6c542ccad2e419d4e3c47/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Question/Question.php#L55 vs. https://github.com/chalasr/symfony/blob/84779a1b4cde11a83ec6c542ccad2e419d4e3c47/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Formatter/OutputFormatter.php#L28

I made the change, refactoring a bit btw so we stop duplications.
If it looks less readable, please say me so I rollback and do the change for each case of the switch that need it.
