For me, there's too many conditionals in that test case you altered. I'd rather implement the class prefix case as a separate one. Notice that you introduce an additional argument just to use it in one of the cases.

Don't forget to [fix the build](http://hook.fabbot.io/report/symfony/symfony/9880/a1b8d6ea6361b7d9af938d2d6e3ce8fa22939915) (licence header is missing).

@jakzal

Thanks for your notice. I added header, how I can run rebuild?

>  I'd rather implement the class prefix case as a separate one

if it is common practice in symfony - I can do that. But on my mind there is no advantages. This logic implemented in one method. If I create new one test case - there will be many dupe logic with current one, also as testing same logic twice.

@ewgRa I agree with @jakzal here. Can you make the needed changes?

Ok, no problem. Later will extract it to new test case.
