For consistency and performance, I'd prefer we'd use `'\\' === DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` everywhere :)

@nicolas-grekas Hm, yeah, we could save a function call. What do the other core team members think?

In tests, I would vote for the constant definition check. This makes the check more obvious, and the performance gain in the testsuite would not be noticeable anyway, given that each test runs only a few times (once only most of the time)

So, what about checking for the presence of `PHP_WINDOWS_VERSION` build in tests and checking for the value of `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` in the rest of the code?

@xabbuh Let's be consistent everywhere and only use the DIRECTORY_SEPERATOR test.
