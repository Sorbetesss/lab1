@aitboudad Any news on this one?

technically, this is a BC break if someone has a ``\`` at the end of a part.

Btw, a simpler solution (avoiding the issue about having to escape ``\`` itself) would be to escape the pipe by doubling it (similar to the escaping of single quotes in YAML, or in SQL strings on Postgresql).
And this would even be almost BC. People cannot have a part ending with a pipe character today anyway. the only reason to have a double pipe would be to have one of the pluralization alternatives being an empty string, but this looks really weird.

I agree with @stof. Doubling the pipe to escape it seems the way to go. @aitboudad What do you think?
