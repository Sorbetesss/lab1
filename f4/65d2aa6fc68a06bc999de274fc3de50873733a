 I understand the mission of format on normalize method, but in  denormalize case I  don't see it as crearly, cause as a result we obtain an hydrated object, so i understand that has nothing to do with Json or Xml.
 Anyway, I understand that normalize & denormalize uses the same base concepts.... so, when you say to use something like ignoredAttributes, did you mean to use a setter on camelizedAttributes?, and that way, using it on formatAttribute removing dependence from format, isn't it?

yes.

Ok I agree with that! , I expect to have this PR updated as you say as soon as posible, possibly, tonight!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done!, now it's using camelizedAttributes, that if needed, has to be set before invoking  denormalize , I think that is a cleanner implementation.

I agree with @marcosQuesada when he says that it seems there is no point in having a format parameter when  denormalizing. What is the point of having it? I don't see a clear use case

@ricardclau: there might be some case where the decoder cannot do a perfect job. f.e. i could imagine some edge case situations with dashes and underscores. but yeah i am not aware of any core denormalizer using this parameter.

Done! Interesting case @lsmith77.

Updated readability on closure, did you mean that? let me now if there's anything more to correct

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

thx .. looks good to me now @fabpot

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by marcosQuesada at 2013-02-13T13:56:50Z

@fabpot Is there anything else to add? Maybe, I have to prepare documentation about that ..?  thx @lsmith77

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lsmith77 at 2013-02-13T19:56:02Z

I guess this should go into 2.3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2013-02-13T19:57:48Z

Indeed, this will be considered for 2.3. In the meantime, you should send a pull request to the documentation repository.
