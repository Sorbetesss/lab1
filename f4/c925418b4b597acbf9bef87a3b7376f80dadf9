Ok I updated wording/docblock, added tests and support for IPv4-mapped IPv6s (which complicates things a little, if anyone sees a better way to do this feel free, as long as the tests pass..), and now remove the last 8 bytes (/64 equivalent) of IPv6s.

For me it's ready to ship now but any feedback is appreciated.
