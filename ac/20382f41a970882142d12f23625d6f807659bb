We already have `TwigErrorRenderer` in TwigBridge, what about move the `SerializerErrorRenderer` + definition to the Serializer component instead?

Good idea @yceruto, done

Could we move the `SerializerErrorRenderer` class too? or it's too late :( ?

I was wondering if we could make these error renderers `@experimental` or `@internal` ... ?

internal: no, api platform uses it
experimental: no, that's 4.4
