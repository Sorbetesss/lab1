Are you sure that this change is necessary (the code has been the same since its initial commit, hasn't it?)? The tests that I see are failing, do fail because of the missing Finder component (see #12398 for a fix).

Sure: see https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/builds/39832453
If the line is old, then the test must be new (and right).

Oh, yes you're right. The test was introduced in #12329 in the 2.3 branch.
