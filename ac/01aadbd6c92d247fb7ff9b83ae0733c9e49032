@antanas-arvasevicius Can you confirm that this change is not necessary if #21811 gets merged?

added test cases for this.
Revertion is not needed, as this bug is due inconsistent getUserProviderId() usage, sometimes it was called like: getUserProviderId(strtolower($name)); sometimes like getUserProviderId($name);

I think it's better to accept this PR as this will prevent that kind of bugs in the future.

test errors on 5.5 7.1  https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/206617501#L2417
Error: Class 'Doctrine\ORM\Version' not found
?
How to this fix? Or better remove test case completely?

@antanas-arvasevicius Indeed, just removing the `orm` part of the configuration should be enough.
