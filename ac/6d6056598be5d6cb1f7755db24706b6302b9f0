Can't we create a test case that would fail without these changes?

I don't quite understand this test fail:

```
1) Warning
The data provider specified for Symfony\Bridge\Twig\Tests\Extension\FormExtensionTest::testInitRuntimeAndAccessRenderer is invalid.
Trying to configure method "get" which cannot be configured because it does not exist, has not been specified, is final, or is static
2) Warning
The data provider specified for Symfony\Bridge\Twig\Tests\Extension\FormExtensionTest::testAccessRendererAndInitRuntime is invalid.
Trying to configure method "get" which cannot be configured because it does not exist, has not been specified, is final, or is static
```

I'm mocking `Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface`.

Looks like you need to add your tests to the `legacy` group.

@xabbuh thanks looks better now. One test fail left: https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/287174522

You need to add `symfony/dependency-injection` to the `require-dev` section of TwigBridge's `composer.json` file.
