Looks like it should be done on 3.4
@michaelKaefer Can you rebase on 3.4 and fix the tests? Thank you.

@xabbuh Sorry, I'm not able. Can you help me?

I wanted to rebase (never did that) with:

    git clone https://github.com/michaelKaefer/symfony/
    cd symfony
    git fetch
    git branch patch-2 origin/patch-2
    git checkout patch-2
    git branch 3.4 origin/3.4
    git rebase 3.4

--> the rebase tells me that there are confilcts (the first one in src/Symfony/Component/Console/Helper/SymfonyQuestionHelper.php) and I have to merge. This seems wrong to me, what am I doing wrong?
