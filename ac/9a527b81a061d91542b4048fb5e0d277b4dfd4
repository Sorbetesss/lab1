You will also need to update the XML schema definition.

What I mean is that you will have to update [this block](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Resources/config/schema/symfony-1.0.xsd#L99-L114) to allow to use the new option in XML configs.

I think being able to configure all options in the config make sense (rebase on current 2.7 as we've just added 4 new options from 7.1). Doing that in a somewhat automated way would be even better if possible.

I don't know how could it be automated.

I rebased against 2.7 and squashed my commits into one.
