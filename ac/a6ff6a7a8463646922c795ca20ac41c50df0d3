Does it concern only CSS or may it involve also other mime types, like js ?

@Pierstoval the JS strategy is automatically applied for JS files in all Symfony versions (or at least, it was already applied before Symfony 2.7).

@Pierstoval : AFAIU, js was already handled correctly: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/13141, but css handling was only introduced in symfony >=2.7 which dropped Twig <1.18 support.

EDIT: too slow. :)
