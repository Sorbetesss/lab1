In #29830, @pravdinalex reported that the 3.4 branch lacks support for those options as well. Was this PR intentionally opened against the master branch?

As this is a new "feature" it must be against `master` per definition, right?

Is it? The new feature has been implemented in php itself and the HTTP Foundation component already supports it. One could argue that this PR merely solves a configuration issue of the Framework Bundle.

I don't have a clear opinion on this. I've just noticed a contradiction between the linked issue and the PR and thought I should mention it. ğŸ˜ƒ

yes indeed, my first intention was to make it a bugfix for the 3.4 branch.

But as it can change the behavior of the application and can be set in the application, it sounds like a new feature. But I'm open to change it.

That's a new feature to me. Reports that ask for bug fixes but really ask for feature are not uncommon :)
