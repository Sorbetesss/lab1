Hey!

I think @alexandre-daubois has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

@alamirault That's an awesome addition I would love to have as part of the property normalizer.
I found a typo in your changes, but unfortunately hit the wrong button, my bad.
Is there anything I could do to help this PR getting done? ðŸ™‚
