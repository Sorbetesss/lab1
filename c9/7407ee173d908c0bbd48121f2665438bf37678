Can you add a unit test to avoid regressions? Thanks.

@fabpot maybe 72374eb should target 2.7 to ease future upstream merges/diffs...

Indeed, merging it in 2.7 would greatly help

Would a PR do? Can you also please have a look at #19776 and decide what to do? I'd prefer this PR as a whole (all fixes can target master).

Can you rebase on current master?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2016-10-05T17:48:36Z

Done.

@ro0NL Sorry about that but can you rebase one last time? When done, ping me so that I can merge ASAP to avoid any problems. Thanks.

@fabpot done. Replayed the before/after scenarios once more, and still all good. Waiting for travis though :)

edit: green :)
