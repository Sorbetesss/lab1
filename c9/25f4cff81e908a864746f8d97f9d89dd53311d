This looks weird to me, because `getKernelExpectingRequest` says it already allows a delta for the `REQUEST_TIME` in its phpdoc.

Looks like 1s of delta is too small for AppVeyor

Good catch. In my link the test failed because a delta of 2 seconds.
Moreover the delta in not applied to the `REQUEST_TIME` header, but everything :/ I think it's better to use `@group time-sensitive` instead.
