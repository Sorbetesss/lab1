Hey!

I think @shrikeh has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

> I don't really understand the use case for the max uuid. But as it is part of the spec, I'm fine with adding it.

I don't have one either, but for completeness with the spec yes. Having it available might enable some use cases we'll know about one day :)
