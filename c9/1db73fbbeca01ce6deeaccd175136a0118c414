@chs2 Can you change the target branch to 2.7 (and resolve the conflicts there)?

Resolving the conflict will take a little time.
I may have reached the limitations of my git(hub) knowledges.
I'm even sure of the correct way to acccomplish the switch of target branch and the conflict resolving.
Any tips ?

The easiest is probably to close this PR and open a new one :)
