That was not my question. ðŸ˜‰ Messenger 4.4 did have support for Redis and the logic was eventually moved to the file you're fixing here.

I suppose the code was in `src/Symfony/Component/Messenger/Transport/RedisExt/Connection.php` in 4.4.

Ok, my bad! should backport the PR to 4.4 as well  @fabpot ?

Please rebase on 4.4 and do the change on that file, yes. We will take care of applying the patch to the new location when merging up.
