@stof is right, I read too fast. We should avoid to `unwrap` when not strictly needed.

the only place needing to unwrap is the form renderer engine, because it relies on internal Twig APIs to manipulate blocks (which is bad news, as there is no BC guarantee for them)

I can't do much about the unwrapping in `TwigRendererEngine` and would advise against changing `TwigEngine`: it's a deprecated class anyway and we're risking a BC break.

Status: needs review

CI failure seems to be an internal hiccup at Travis.
