The PR related to this behaviour change is phpDocumentor/ReflectionDocBlock#89 (note the change regular expression). I guess that this should be solved in the the `phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock` package (e.g. by ignoring "invalid" tags or so).

@xabbuh Do we need to open an issue on the upstream repo about this BC break?
