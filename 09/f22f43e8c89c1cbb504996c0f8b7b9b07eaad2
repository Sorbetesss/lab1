Change documented and functionally tested.

I can't imagine any existing feature impacted by this change. Also, the fixed ticket is 2 years old and it seems everyone agree this would be useful, it makes things simpler.

That said , I would love to get this in 3.3.

I may have read too quickly, but doesn't this remove an XML file that maybe of use to some tier tools? Eg the phpstorm SF plugin and the likes?

@nicolas-grekas You're right, the phpstorm plugin relies on.
I managed to make this work using the container dumped by the `ContainerBuilderDebugDumpPass`, this does not deprecate it anymore. It should even improve the features of the phpstorm plugin.

PhpStorm Plugin point of view. as i see this PR just extends the xml files, so i am able to resolve https://github.com/Haehnchen/idea-php-symfony2-plugin/issues/618 on my side

üëç (and üëç for 3.3 for me, it's really a bug fix)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think we are good here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can we reconsider the milestone here? A lot of services can be made private in 3.3, it would be too bad to miss them.

I also think we should reconsider this a bug fix for 3.3. "Types" are much more important in 3.3... but there's no way to get a list of them. And currently we can't even use `debug:container` because almost all of the types aliases are private and don't show up currently.

When I run `debug:container --show-private` and filter for ids that are class names, I get exactly **4**. With this PR I get 36.

Would it be possible to bump this to 3.3 as a bug fix?
