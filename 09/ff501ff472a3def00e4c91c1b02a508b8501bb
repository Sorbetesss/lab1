Shouldn't we rather check how the credentials could end up being `null` at all instead?

I think I agree with @xabbuh here. I think this should be fixed in `UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener` and a `LogicException` should be thrown instead - this is not a user error (like blank password), but a developer error.

A similar thing ? https://gist.github.com/Shine-neko/76f97ee46950a480074434fa3259f797/revisions

Yes, seems good. Although I think the error message can be changed, so we can give the developer guidelines on how to fix it (e.g. adding the expected password parameter named - `$this->options['password_parameter']`).

Any news? It looks the gist code is more in line with what we should do.
