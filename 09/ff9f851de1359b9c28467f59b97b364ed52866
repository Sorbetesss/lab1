Let's see if this change makes Travis CI (partially) happy again.

Maybe the same trick could be used for ``getHash`` on all platforms

@stof Which `getHash()` call do you refer to?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2015-10-01T16:15:29Z

@xabbuh ``SplObjectStorage::getHash``, which is marked as deprecated but without triggering the warning currently because even PHP is calling it when attaching, not only HHVM

@stof I see, I updated `getHash()` as well. Tests pass on HHVM.
