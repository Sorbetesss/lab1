So, only an issue in tests? Shouldn't this be applied on previous branches? Any potential BC break spotted by this failure?

Not sure why PHP 7 builds are failing here:

```
Could not load package symfony/framework-bundle in file:///home/travis/build/symfony/symfony: [UnexpectedValueException] Invalid version string "master.999"
```

Yes, only issue with tests. It's a result of changes made on master.

> #19325 relied on a wrong count of messages, which was fixed by #19878.

The #19325 test is only present in the master branch, so it wasn't a problem until #19878 was merged to master.

> Additionally, the getContainer() method on the master branch expect messages to be indexed by domain.

Again, this is only on master.

I'll look at this asap, should be related to the changes I made yesterday, that were far from easy :)
