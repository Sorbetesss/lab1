One thing I didn't want to change, is the fact that the [validatorGuesser](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Validator/ValidatorTypeGuesser.php#L153) guesses  "Range" constraints to be a `number` FormType.

It might make sense to change this into this new `range` FormType, but this will break BC.

Please add tests for your new form type. and this will make you notice that you forgot to implement the support of the range type in the PHP form theme

@stof: ok.. are there currently formtype tests available, as I cannot find them. Maybe i'm looking in the wrong place?

@jaytaph You can have a look at the tests in ``src/Symfony/Component/Form/Tests/Extension/Core/Type``.

@xabbuh I did, but types like EmailType etc are not in there as well, so I was a bit confused on where tests where. I've found the tests that @stof mentioned inside the Twig Bridge, which turns out failed on the missing php templates. I've added these, and the tests seem fine again.
