Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.x branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

> I think we should also add a test that handles a call of the command with a config file being passed as well as other options.

I've added a simple mixed test, ~~settings from yaml config will have priority in this case~~

I have changed the load order to allow overrides by console args...

A short overview for the last changes:

I have added some tests which handles mixed arguments from config and options from console. I have also changed the load order to allow overrides by console options. With that it is possible to override the values â€‹â€‹provided from lint config by console options. @xabbuh

I'm divided about this proposal. I love the new options that you added to the command but I'm not sure about providing support for a new config file specifically to run this command.

Just asking: if we keep all the new command options, could a makefile task be an alternative to this config file? You would add the values of all the command options to create a very long command ... but since it's a Makefile, you don't have to actually type or remember the long command, only a short alias. Maybe it's not possible, I don't know.

As a poor version of the Makefile, a simple `lint.sh` or `lint.bat` script in the `bin/` dir of the project could work too to avoid passing all the long option values. Cheers!

@javiereguiluz Thanks for your feedback.

No problem I think we can hold the `--exclude` option and drop the config part. If so, I can refactor and rebase the branch in the next days. OK?

@christingruber thanks ... but maybe we should wait for other comments from @symfony/mergers first. The reason is that in my previous comment I only gave my opinion ... and a single person opinion is not important. Better see what's the general consensus about what to do here. Thanks!

Thanks for your work on this.

> I would be happy to see this PR with only the exclude feature.

Same for me :)
