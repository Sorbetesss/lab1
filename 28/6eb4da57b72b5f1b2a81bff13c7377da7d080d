> privates should be excluded from getServiceIds

right, private are "invisible"

> did we forget to deprecate checking privates with initialized

looks like so, we have to do it in 3.4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3 no? the sooner the better right; given 3.3 is still in RC fase, cant we push it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2017-05-20T14:17:40Z

3.4 is fine, 3.3 is closed for "features" (deprecations are)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rebase needed

Can't we merge all your DI related PRs into one big PR that removes all deprecated code paths for that component? That would be easier to review IMO.

Not sure.. if it's OK i'd like to do it per feature :) prepared the PR's pretty well, and like to test/rebase after each update.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2017-05-22T07:40:47Z

so, you can rebase again

ping @ro0NL do you need help for this one? would be great to finish it before working on your other ones :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2017-07-17T08:21:49Z

@nicolas-grekas rebased. To me it's ready.. :)

Perhaps something to start thinking about; are we allowed to break alias chains?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2017-07-17T11:43:32Z

ie? isn't that something already handled by some compiler pass (resolving aliases?)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ro0NL at 2017-07-17T11:53:30Z

Hm, if you have `public_service > some_alias > private_service`, i believe doing `$container->set('some_alias', $newService)` at any point after compilation, happily unsets the alias and sets a new service in between.

Not really played with it yet, just looking at the code path :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I said: this is already resolved by a compiler pass so it cannot happen in practice.
