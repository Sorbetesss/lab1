For reference, this was done to ease with dumping AST. With NameNode, `$foo->foo()` is dumped as is.
With this change, it will be dumped as `$foo->"foo"()`.
But BC is of paramount importance, so :+1:
Maybe adjust `Node::dump()` to deal with this case thought?

@nicolas-grekas Indeed, tweaking `dump()` to take care of that would be ideal. Can you prepare a patch?

Would it be OK to add a new node type that extends `ConstantNode`, to be used in this case? Because unescaping strings while dumping has some code smell to me.

Not sure :)
