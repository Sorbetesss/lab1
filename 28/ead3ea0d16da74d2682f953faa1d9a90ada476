This deprecation will deteriorate the DX when using String instances in twig  😐

Why not adding a second parameter that would dictate if the cut must happen before or after the word beeing cut in ?

I do not know how much it's being used within Twig, is it a very common function in there ?
Also for the proposal, it would be possible but consider:
```php
public function truncate(int $length, string $ellipsis = '', bool $cut = true, bool $strict = true): static
```
`true, true`  would mean CharStrict but `true, false`  would mean Char, which is something that is kinda useless/not required here :confused: that's why I prefered a more "declarative" mode over 2 booleans.

Yep absolutely right.

But with the bool not beeing deprecated my point is obselete anyway :) And if we want, we can add a |truncate filter with bool or named parameter in Twig, that use the new Enums 👍

Just some suggestion regarding the names and docblock..

To _me_ it seems easier to understand the use cases / differences...

but feel free to ignore... as DX is always very personal :)

```diff
- TruncateCut
+ TruncateMode
```
?

Also the PR title needs some update
