@jeroennoten thanks for this contribution! However, `4.3` branch is no longer maintained, so this should be submitted against `4.4` (see https://symfony.com/releases for the full details). Thanks.

Hi @javiereguiluz, thanks for your feedback. I rebased to 4.4 and changed the target branch this pull request to 4.4.
