Thanks for PR. Can we wait for https://wiki.php.net/rfc/true-type RFC also?

I planned to do it as soon as it is merged if this PR is merged before "true" is available, but yeah I can definitely embed it as well in this pull request 👍

@alexandre-daubois Can you update the PropertyInfo's conflict rule + dev requirement for symfony/serializer so that it only allows serializer v4.4.42 or higher? That should fix the low-deps build

I'll take a look into that as soon as possible!

Wait, it's the opposite actually 🤦‍♂️ Serializer needs `symfony/property-info` >=4.4.1. Sorry for the bad hint!

Right, makes more sense :smile: At least, I figured out what are high-deps/low-deps builds. Thank you Robin!
