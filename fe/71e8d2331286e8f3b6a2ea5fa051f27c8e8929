@Zarcox thanks for submitting your first contribution! I hope this is the first of many :)

Although your PR looks simple, it's related to a controversial topic. In theory, any string added in the code is considered "a magic string" and must be moved to a constant. But in practice, sometimes we keep the strings when they are not part of a critical feature or the occurrences are not many.

For example:

* This proposal to remove "magic strings" was merged: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/e5536f0fe10421da7ebbe0071343e94d039dfb97
* This proposal to remove "magic strings" was rejected: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22147

So maybe this PR gets rejected too, but please don't let that discourage you to send more PR in the future. Thanks!

In this specific case the improvement is obvious, as it's now an error prone constant - the official name is [XML in caps](https://www.w3.org/XML/) and `'XML'` does not work currently. For the HTTP response codes to any developer worth his salt `302` is much clearer than the 'human readable equivalent', besides being [rigidly standardized](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) in its own right. 302 is therefore not really a magic string, it's just The Constant itself.

So I'm in favor of this change.
