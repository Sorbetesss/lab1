@rybakit What are the implications here? What is the reason for the change?

@drak the reason is trivial, the change allows to bypass unnecessary `is_dir()` call for every bundle from `kernel.bundles`. For example, for the symfony-standard configuration it will save 11 calls in the prod environment (cold start).

@rybakit These checks being done only when compiling the container, they are not an issue in prod, as they are only done when deploying

@stof Agree, my example was not a good one. Anyway, why not speed up the compilation process a bit?
