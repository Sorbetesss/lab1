The CI is supposed to detect when a translation is missing from a file and to suggest running the sync-translations.php script to invite doing so to update the PR. Can you please check why this didn't run?

This makes me realize that this handling of plural translations is wrong. Plurals are way more complex as we know. We should instead use a translation key that will allow the translator to select the most appropriate plural.
Up to have a look?

I figured out the code does already define the "%count%" parameter so that we can use plural forms in the translation. I used GPT to add a 2nd commit here that leverages that.
