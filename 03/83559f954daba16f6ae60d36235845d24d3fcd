Shouldn't the import() and export() methods of the profiler be deprecated as well? https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/Profiler/Profiler.php#L141

I agree the import/export can be removed. I never used it myself. And if somebody needs similar functionality, he can implement it himself easily as he has access to all methods needed.

We agreed on deprecated the commands, not the methods, but I think it makes sense. I will do that now.
