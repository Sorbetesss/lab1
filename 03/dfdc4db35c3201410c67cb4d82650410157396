**Update:** Extracting translation messages from services (e.g. controllers and other PHP files) that have the translator injected into them by using the following service injection methods: (properties, bindings, construct arguments and method calls).

BUT they're other methods that I can't to reach (e.g. the service locator related to: services subscriber and controller service arguments) I need help to accomplish it, maybe @nicolas-grekas ?

The next move will be create some functional test (if possible) and a demo project.

Should I solve here all fabbot issues related to use short array?

yes, please fix fabbot issues or your PR will conflict soon.

@nicolas-grekas this is ready on my side, how does it look for you?

Friendly ping.

Maybe I should split this PR into two for an easier review? I mean, move the last point that contains a little more complexity:
> * All PHP files from services "`translator` aware" via constructor argument, public property, method calls, service subscriber, controller argument)
