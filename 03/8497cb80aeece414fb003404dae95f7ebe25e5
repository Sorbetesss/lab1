If you rebase your pr, then Travis will be green (if everything is alright).

Travis for 4.4 was red when you started this pr.

Hi @Nyholm
I've finally fixed this Travis bug with the version 7.3 & 7.4. I had to add `symfony-kernel` in dev requirement to be able to test this dataCollector :+1:

It's all green now :)
