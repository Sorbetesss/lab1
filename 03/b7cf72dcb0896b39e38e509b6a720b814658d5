`addObjectResource` and `ReflectionClassResource` now track mtimes of parents, traits and interfaces.

Hash computation, file and class existence is now done lazily - ie after the resources are deduplicated.

And to prevent checking the hash again when it was found valid in a previous run, files are "touched" when needed.
