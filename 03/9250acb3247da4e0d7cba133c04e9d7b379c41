I have a very minor comment about the naming of `services_resetter` ID and `ServicesResetter` class name. It looks too specific to me. In the [latest "A month of PHP-FIG" post](https://medium.com/php-fig/a-month-of-php-fig-1-october-2017-af253682ef5b) @michaelcullum refers to this feature as *"Interface for State Resettable classes"*. So, maybe `StateResetter` would be a more appropriate generic name? Maybe not. Just saying. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz I don't understand the consideration. Anyway, that's in the dI subnamespace, where we talk about "services", so I don't think we need to change the name.

Ok now I read the FIG's blog post :) Services is the term we use in Symfony, so the current naming is correct to me.
