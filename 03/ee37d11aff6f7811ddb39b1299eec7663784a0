@cordoval my bad, I did not check the how to before...
Now that I am thinking about it, should this be on different branch? Which one?

master is fine

just add the PR table template on your Pr description
http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html#make-a-pull-request

and append to your title the beginning [Validator]
