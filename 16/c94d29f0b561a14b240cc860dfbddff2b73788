wouldn't this be covered by #11646 after merging 2.3 into 2.4 ?

@stof The tests for 2.3 and 2.4 are not identical because some 2.4 features don't exist in the 2.3 branch.

ping @stof @Tobion

:+1: for me, but it would be good to wait for the PR to 2.3 to be merged and propagated to 2.4 first, so that the diff for this commit would contain only the difference between the 2.3 and 2.4 tests rather than all files again

@stof Ok, let's do that.

I merged #11646 now and merged 2.3 into 2.4. As you can see, the resulting diff is quite small (I don't know why the updated UserPasswordValidatorTest wasn't merged forward correctly from 2.3).

:+1:
could you please merge 2.4 into 2.5 and then 2.5 into master after wise?
