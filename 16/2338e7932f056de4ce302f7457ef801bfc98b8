I think we should better remove the link for the moment as the documentation isn't available yet.

Well, the doc PR is in progress, as mentioned [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/6402)

@xabbuh the first version of the doc will be available very soon, so I think we could merge this fix.
