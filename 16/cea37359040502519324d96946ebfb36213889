👍 I had this patch in mind since day one but never found the time to do it thanks very much 🎉

I personally hesitated between:

- This solution
- Having a null encoder (the patch I used on my side meanwhile)
- Adding a `DenormalizerAware` which IMO is more appropriate than `SerializerAware`

Thanks for this fix, looks great for me.

For me this feature was the most expected of the 3.2, I hope we can have this one merged within the first release !

IMO it should be merged as a bug fix in the 3.1 branch (and so we'll be in the next minor version of 3.2).

@dunglas : 3.1? But it was introduced in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/19277 which has been merged in 3.2 only 😕

Sorry, you're right, it should be merged in 3.2.
