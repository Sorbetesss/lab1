I would like to add tests for the `EmailChannel`, `SmsChannel` and `ChatChannel` here as well, but wanted to wait for #35773 first.

If you are fine with only merging `AbstractChannelTest` and `ChannelPolicyTest` we could indeed target 5.0 for now. Then I could do the tests for `EmailChannel`, `SmsChannel` and `ChatChannel` later or in #35773.

What do you think?

Yes please: tests that run on 5.0 should be submitted there. Then tests for new notifiers should go on master.
