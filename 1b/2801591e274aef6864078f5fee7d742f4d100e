@nicolas-grekas Haha... I really like this simplification... but I don't understand how it works! :) Is there some significance to the service id matching the autowired interface? Otherwise... I would still expect that if I had 10 services for an interface (e.g. LoggerInterface)... that now it would simply appear that I would have *11* services for that interface. Clearly, I'm missing something ;)

It is very simple: if there is a service named "Foo\BarInterface", then that's the one, when looking to wire a "Foo\BarInterface" type hint.

this is a very elegant solution to the problem, allowing to use third-party services to autowire a type (as your alias can point to any service), and forbidding to explicitly configure the same autowired type twice for different services (as service ids are unique).

So üëç for me.

Great! :+1:

Ha, I missed the change to `AutowirePass`. Of course, it makes sense! We'll need a docs issue so we can update things.

@stof comments addressed, thanks

btw, my comment about using private aliases for this is also true for the documentation when writing it

Docs issue created - I added a note on there about your (Stof) "private aliases" comment.
