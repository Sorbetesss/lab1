>In weak mode, this PR also disables colors.

That's the only change I'm not really fond of to be honest: if you don't want colors I would expect to set the PHPUnit colors configuration at `false`.

Otherwise :+1:

@theofidry we don't access to phpunit configuration. PR welcomed if anyone thinks this is of importance.

>we don't access to phpunit configuration

Is it because it's something that has been needed until now or there is a reason behind that?

>PR welcomed if anyone thinks this is of importance.

In the example of the color, it doesn't really make sense (at least to me) to set this at the bridge level. But I have no idea of how you access to PHPUnit config so if it's too troublesome then it's understandable. It's just a color setting after all...

Code updated to work on 5.3

@theofidry that's it: nobody spent time looking for a way to have tighter phpunit integration, because as you said:
>It's just a color setting after all...

Fair.

This PR will require to update the doc though.

@theofidry would you like opening it please?

Tests added

@nicolas-grekas shouldn't most of these tests actually be added in older branches ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2016-03-21T10:07:48Z

@stof right, but it's much simpler for me to make them work on master first, and backport afterwards

The testing framework for the phpunit bridge now prefers the local implementation when on master, and the one provided by packagist for other branches.

Will you backport them before merging this PR though ? It would make the git history cleaner by avoiding to add them twice.

Looks good to me. :+1:

@nicolas-grekas can you answer my previous question ?
