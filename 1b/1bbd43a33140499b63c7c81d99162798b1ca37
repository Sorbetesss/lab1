I've updated the changelogs to be for 4.1

Service definitions should be fixed now, tests are passing :+1:  My PC only froze for 10 minutes after which I rebooted via the on/off button, due to a minor recursion issue I created during the process.

@chalasr I removed the line where I mentioned adding it based on feedback earlier. I can put something back in there if desired. What were you thinking of?

@iltar I mean only the CHANGELOG file, not upgrade ones :)

Something in the form of: `Added the ability to profile individual argument value resolvers via the  Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Controller\ArgumentResolver\TraceableValueResolver`?
