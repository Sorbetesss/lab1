Forget what I said, `Symfony\Component\Form\Tests\Extension\Core\EventListener\TrimListenerTest` is still failing

This implementation does not seem to work, anyway

Reopening as waiting for the PHPUnit release was necessary for ``phpunit --self-update`` to give us a fixed version

arf, PHP 5.3.3 does not have openssl on Travis :disappointed:

@romainneutron an alternative could be to download ``https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar`` with wget and replacing the existing phar with it, instead of asking PHPUnit to perform the download. This would fix the openssl issue on 5.3.3
