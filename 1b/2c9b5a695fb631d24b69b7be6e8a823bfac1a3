Hey!

I think @lucasaba has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

@nicolas-grekas @fabpot given that this PR is about moving away from a deprecated DBAL API for the collector of the Symfony webprofiler, I suggest merging that into 5.4 rather than 6.1, so that the Symfony LTS does not use the deprecated API for years for the debug features.

Sounds reasonable. Let's do that.

@l-vo Can you please rebase your PR on the 5.4 branch and make sure your new code is compatible with PHP 7.3?

@derrabus @stof target branch changed to 5.4. Should I do another PR to 6.1 after merge to restore modern additions brought by php >=8 ?

If we don't do this already while merging up, please create that PR.
