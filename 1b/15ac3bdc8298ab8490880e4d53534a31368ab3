Please use `sprintf` for exception messages, instead of concatenating variables into the message:

> Yes, using sprintf is what the coding standard should document. Can you
submit a PR on the docs? And perhaps a PR on symfony/symfony to fix
inlined exceptions?

Also see [Symfony coding standards](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html#structure) last item under structure:

> Exception message strings should be concatenated using sprintf.

According to https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/issues/1944 this is not fully safe against race conditions either. And now we might throw exceptions in placed where it worked before.

@Tobion : the same as in #16292 - pattern and solution; I'm not sure if this breaks BC.

Exceptions message generation changed in favor of sprintf
