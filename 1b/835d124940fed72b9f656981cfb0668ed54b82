TIL: I cannot approve my own pull request. ðŸ˜…

One question though: Weâ€™ve already had checks like this one in place:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5765539a3c798618b75bf79fe18181c4cd259a18/src/Symfony/Bridge/Monolog/Logger.php#L32-L34

Are those obsolete now or do we intend to keep them?
