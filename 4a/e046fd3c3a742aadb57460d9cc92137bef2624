I've added tests to make sure the checkbox row doesn't break again in bootstrap 3 & 4.

TwigBridge tests were failing because of the changes made in #24703, so i fixed them as well.

Tests are still failing, but this is related due to the timezone changes.

Please let me know if there's anything else i can do to get this merged.

@stof i've added more whitespace control tags to remove indentation spaces.

deps=low tests should not fail: Form's lowest dep for the bridge should be bumped (or vice-versa, didn't look precisely)

@nicolas-grekas not sure what to do now, the deps are already on `~3.4|~4.0`.

should be `~3.4-beta2|~4.0`

correct me if i'm wrong, but even changing the deps wont make the tests running green on deps=low, since travis runs the bridge tests from the vendor-folder (like `/home/travis/build/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/vendor/symfony/form/Tests/AbstractLayoutTest.php:84`) and the fixed tests are only in this PR.

it will: the CI builds per PR packages for that situation

@fabpot i reverted the change for bootstrap 3 & 4.
