the failure with deps=low in the Security component seems related to a bug in PHPUnit 5.0

Edit: reported as https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1886

and for deps=high, it is because 2.8 needs to be merged into master to add the new class

Once this PR is merged, I will work on the update of the component for 3.0 to avoid using SplObjectStorage (I prefer waiting until this PR is merged to avoid useless conflicts)

@fabpot it would be great to merge 2.8 into master to fix the deps=high builds (this is painful because of the descriptor fixture changes btw)
