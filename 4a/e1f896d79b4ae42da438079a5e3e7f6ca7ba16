Can we fix the location that is reported (it's always `SymfonyTestsListener::endTest` instead of the actual test case)?

@xabbuh cross-process stack trace communication, not trivial to implement.
I'd like to merge this as is now, then fix the HttpFoundation layer.
Then we could improve this a bit. OK to you?
