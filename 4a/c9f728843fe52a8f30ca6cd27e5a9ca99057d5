Confirmed by @nicolas-grekas that the remaining failure in `Validator`'s suite for `appveyor` is unrelated.

@nicolas-grekas Is that normal that tests pass in high depth in travis? Shouldn't the validator dependency in the doctrine bridge be updated?

Ok I got it, tests are not running on 3.1, so maybe we should add a conflict?
