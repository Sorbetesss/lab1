Note that Mintty is used in Cygwin, so this would mean that Cygwin users get colored output for free now, without the need to use a second tool handling colors just to make the color support detected (or to pass ``--ansi`` explicitly all the time)

Sounds like a bug to me, should be merged in 2.3 instead.
