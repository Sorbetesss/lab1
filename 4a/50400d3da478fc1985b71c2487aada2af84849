ErrorRendeder instead of ErrorDumper?

I will also remove from the current `ErrorCatcher` everything unrelated to the future `ErrorDumper` and make it work. Later, as last step, let's create/rename both components to `ErrorHandler` and `ErrorDumper` respectively.

That one is nice too. Personally, I like `ErrorDumper` it feels like `VarDumper` but for errors. Let's rename it for another PR.

It would make sense to me to remove error-catcher from the composer.json of the Debug component.
This means using the legacy FlattenException in ExceptionHandler, which is OK.

@nicolas-grekas it's done now, thanks.
