Can you please add a test?

@derrabus I'd be happy to, but given this is my first contribution to Symfony and none of the other sites have tests for this case I would need some guidance.

@derrabus check the last commit, perhaps that would work? If remove the `createTable()` invocation from `DoctrineDbalStore` and/or `PdoStore` the tests will fail now.
