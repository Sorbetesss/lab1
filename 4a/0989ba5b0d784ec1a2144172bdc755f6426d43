@fabpot I've helped with this PR during the hack day so I'm :+1:

This seems to be the only way to revert the BC break partially. This PR brings back [the hack which we used to have](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/6650/files#diff-b21c94d886a3648c0f8a59ef30df1e8aL199), but only for the scenario when there's a single namespace and it is a default namespace. So it simplifies filtering for single namespace documents and keeps it flexible for multiple namespace ones.

It might be worth documenting. I'll send a PR if we all agree it's good to merge.

@jakzal You're the boss here, so let's document this properly.
@crudecki Can you rebase your PR to remove the merge commit and avoid any non-related commits?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@crudecki also, ubot suggest a small CS fix ;)

I think we should also update the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.4/src/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/CHANGELOG.md):

    `Crawler::addXmlContent()` removes the default document namespace again if it's an only namespace.

I've removed the unnecessary merge

@crudecki Great, can you add the suggested change in the CHANGELOG?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done it through Github interface, hope this is fine.

Doing so through github interface results in a new PR: #9800

@crudecki Go at this page: https://github.com/crudecki/symfony/blob/crawlerDefaultNamespaceFix/src/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/CHANGELOG.md and edit file there, after that it will be in this PR so you can close #9800.
