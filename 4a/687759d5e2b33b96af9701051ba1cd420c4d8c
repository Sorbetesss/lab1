Wouldn't it be better to share the code instead of copy/pasting it?

Where would stay this code? There is no dependency in common between `console` and `http-kernel`. And creating a new component just for this method looks overkill.

@sroze these are two independent components, so sharing is not possible without creating new deps, which we don't want to.

This seems to break the appveyor build :/ (ran twice, same breakage with no output)

Not a bug fix, should be merged in 3.4 instead.
