Isn't there a lot more than those 4 commands? What about `LintCommand` for instance? :)

(I guess keeping this in #20586 would be less painful to update as you target master too for this bug fix ðŸ˜…)

@ogizanagi I made the changes only where it makes sense in my opinion, which exclude commands where the output give no relevant information at all.

I just applied it on the `TwigLintCommand` which makes use of `SymfonyStyle::error`, because the output is intended to be redirected, but at the moment I don't see more commands to update.

Not that much, each one can be merged independently and, since the subject of #20586 was "Add getErrorIo AND use stderr in existing commands", I do think it should be done in two PRs :)

Note that when exceptions are thrown (which is the case in lot of commands including lint ones), the output goes to stderr naturally.

@chalasr : I may have found some other places where it'll be relevant. See https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/20674

Oh, I could have did it here if you just said me.. but ok then

I had to check relevant places myself so it was simpler to submit it ðŸ˜…

Having two places to discuss/review/merge about the same thing looks not simpler to me, as you wish.

Apply the patch then and I'll close mine.

Updated for using `getErrorStyle()` in the FrameworkBundle (as it requires the console to be `~3.3`) and fixed the WebServerBundle commands.
