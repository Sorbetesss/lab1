We should also handle the case of unquoted values containing a ``:``, which are currently accepted in some cases by the Symfony parser (see https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/pull/113)

I updated the handling of the `|` and `>` characters and now also trigger a deprecation when a colon (followed by a space) is used in a mapping value.
