@fabpot is the deprecation notice really needed though? I mean it can be a info/warning log message on behavior change as well right? And perhaps dont log anything in non-quiet mode, but display it to the user instead. Meaning we could deprecate `--no-warmup` right away..

Point is; half the internet does `bin/console c:c` by now, and im not sure getting a deprecation _by default_, makes really sense :thinking: (opposed to informing about `cache:warmup` / changing behavior).

This looks like a good idea to me

@stof you think @ro0NL is a good idea? or just the fact that we deprecate the warmup process in cache:clear?

I was talking about the deprecation of the warmup part. But @ro0NL is right about deprecations by default though

I know for sure i wouldnt care about the deprecation; it would work rather confusing instead, ie;

 _I must/should run cache:warmup now to upgrade properly?_

While we're actually trying to separate things, and let users decide. Hence, it should be informational imo.

> Meaning we could deprecate --no-warmup right away..

Not sure though, as removing it is not the right upgrade path till 4.0.. tough one :)

edit: yep.. we should definitely deprecate `--no-warmup` _after_ the default behavior has changed.

Now im not even sure we should log/display anything opposed to adding a changelog note?

Doing it in code kinda implies "people dont read changelogs" ;-)

We could _just_ drop it, right?

Just dropping the flag won't work as it would break people using it currently. I don't see any other better way.

I'm going to merge it as is. We will have 2 months to tweak the message if needed.
