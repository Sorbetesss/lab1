Recently `messenger:consume` command was renamed/shortened, so I wonder if this one could be named `messenger:stop` instead?

#30708 has been merged now, so this one can be rebased.

I've kept the longer command name here, because you won't type it often (it's a command to run at deploy mostly) and I think the longer name makes it a bit more descriptive.

This is ready for review! It does actually work locally ;)
