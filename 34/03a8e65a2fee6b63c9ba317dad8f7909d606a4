See comment in #29949: there may be an issue that makes the container load all classes at compile time. We should avoid it if confirmed.

@GuilhemN Thanks for the suggestion. I added the funcionality for `PhpFileLoader`, and as a consequence I moved code from `FileLoader` into `ContainerBuilder` to avoid duplication.

@nicolas-grekas This PR is rather simple so I don't think I've made a change that would cause

> the container load all classes at compile time

At least, I'm not aware of that.
