I missed your comment @wouterj :)
But since not setting/setting to false this option is deprecated in 5.3, I think this should have been part of the cleanup doe in 6.0. `false` yields an exception already in 6.0. Defaulting to something that throws looks odd to me.

Alright, I'm OK with having this in 6.0ðŸ˜‰
