Doesn't this apply to 2.7 too?

I've done this PR against master only as it requires xsd to have a new binary definition. But the actual fix can be applied to all versions I think.

fabbot.io gives an error in a fixture file. Could this be avoided?

You did not cause the error, so you can ignore it, imho.

It deserves a unit test.

I would be more comfortable to merge this change in master instead of in 2.7. It's not that trivial.

I made PR against `master`, not `2.7`. Also, what kind of unit test need to be added? I already added the use case in Dumpers and Loaders. Do you have another type of parameter to check?

ping @derrabus @dunglas @xabbuh Can you change target to `master` instead of `2.7` I do agree that this is a new feature that should go to next version of php. On older version, a bug warning should indicate binary parameters are not well handled.

The CS complaints in the fixtures file can indeed be ignored. But can you please switch back to using explicit `array()` instead of the short array notation in the dumper class? :)

Used traditional array syntax and added test on parameter with a single control char.
