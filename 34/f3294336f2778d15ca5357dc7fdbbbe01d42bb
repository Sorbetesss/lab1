I am not convinced that we should do this for all objects. Maybe it would be better to only support this option for `stdClass` instances.

I agree that it should not be done for any object. It makes sense for stdClass, ArrayObject, and maybe other Traversable objects.

DateTime and DateTimeImmutable should be better dumped as a Yaml timestamp (with a parser flag to parse timestamps as a DateTime rather than as an integer too btw)

I updated here to have the mapping only work with `stdClass` and `ArrayObject` instances instead of each and every kind of object.

see #17836 for the `DateTime` support

This one needs to  be rebased
