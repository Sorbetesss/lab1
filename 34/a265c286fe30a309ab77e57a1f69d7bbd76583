Please implement the `complete()` for pools :)

Thanks for the reviews! I made the following changes:
1. Implemented `complete()`
2. Replaced compiler pass with `tagged_locator`
3. Made `--pool` option an array
4. Exceptions thrown when invalidating tags are displayed but don't cause the command to fail until all pools are attempted.

Tests added. I believe this PR to be ready.

nice addition :)
May I ask you if https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/37880 could be reconsidered for v6? thank you
