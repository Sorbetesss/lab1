What exactly was the bug?

The original envelope was not properly passed along the whole middleware stack when calling `$next($message)`, so items were vanished in between.
This fixes it and also allows altering the message and the envelope items through middlewares.

I've pushed another commit to https://github.com/sroze/symfony/pull/6 for the TraceableBus which misses a small update.
