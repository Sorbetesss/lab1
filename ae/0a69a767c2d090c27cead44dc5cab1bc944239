Interesting. We consider these as bug fixes so it should be fixed on 2.8.
I think there are more places in the code that do these kind of checks, can you update them all?
Could you also please send a PR to update https://github.com/symfony/polyfill/blob/master/src/Php72/Php72.php?
Thanks!

@nicolas-grekas i think that's all, i have search the repository for similar code and i found these checks in `Symfony\Component\VarDumper\Dumper\CliDumper` and `Symfony\Bridge\PhpUnit\DeprecationErrorHandler`
