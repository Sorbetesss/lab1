Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.3".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

I will check also like you did @nicolas-grekas in TwitterOptions to upload medias using https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/statuses/media/

We need to wait until `6.3` branch is created

Thanks for this PR!

One key feature of Mastodon is that it is decentralized and supports the ActivityPub open standard (https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/), so I wonder if we shouldn't use the ActivityPub API they provide instead of the "custom" endpoint.

This would allow the Notifier component to support any app from the Fediverse (WriteFreely, Pleroma, PixelFed, WordPress with the ActivityPub plugin...) and even Symfony apps supporting ActivityPub through [API Platform ActivityPub](https://github.com/api-platform/activity-pub).

The request to do looks like this: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#create-activity-outbox

The only issue is for images. ActivityPub expects the image to be already hosted somewhere or to use an extension to upload it: https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG/ActivityPub/MediaUpload

WDYT?

I think we can do both :)

Really cool :)
Maybe an "option" in DSN? In this PR?
