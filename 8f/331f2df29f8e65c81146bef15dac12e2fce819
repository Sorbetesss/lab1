Not sure about this one. IIUC, the change is only for YAML, but we have other formats as well where you should not add the quotes, right?

Hm. Yes. I'll try to fix this problem by updating the Yaml dumper instead.

I've updated the PR, it fixes the same problem but is only updating the dumper instead of the configuration.

@Nyholm Can you have a look at the tests?

Sure. PR is rebased and tests are updated
