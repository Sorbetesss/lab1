Please add the `@deprecated` phpdoc.

You also need to add `@group legacy` for test files related to the deprecated classes

`src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/DependencyInjection/FrameworkExtension.php` should also be updated to trigger a deprecation notice for people not using the filesystem.

Added `@deprecated` and `@group legacy`.

Deprecation of config options has been done in `Configuration.php` instead of the mentioned `FrameworkExtension.php` file. Is that correct?

LGTM

IMO the `dsn` config makes no sense as well (as you can see with the configs for usrname/password). A better approach would have been a `storage` config option that just accepts a service. Could we change that as well?

I've moved deprecation notices at the beginning of the classes.
