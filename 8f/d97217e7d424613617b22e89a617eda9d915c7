Btw, shouldnt this remove the margin bottom from `.metrics`, to avoid double margins here

The extra space for sub requests to me looks weird, and semi out of place;

Imo. separating groups (of metrics) should look different.

@ro0NL you are right about the excessive bottom margin. It has been fixed now. Thanks!

About the horizontal divider, I don't agree with you ... but this is design and not code, so people can say opposite things and both be right :)

@ro0NL @javiereguiluz I think the added horizontal space (divider) separation is sensible and clean. :+1:
