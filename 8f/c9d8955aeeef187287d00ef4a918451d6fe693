I'd go with a bugfix personally. WDYT @symfony/mergers ?

I agree with a bugfix as it also ensures some kind of security also IMHO

Alright, I rebased on 5.4. The merger may encounter a few conflicts during upmerge, especially with the Time constraint where a new regex is added in upper branches. If necessary, I'll provide a follw-up PR for it and add the relevant test case
