Hi @PF4Public, thanks for you PR. Would you mind rebasing/retargetting for branch 2.7? 2.3 is not maintained anymore and 2.7 will go out of maintenance in 10 days btw)

Hi @nicolas-grekas
Looks like I did it, please check if I've done it corectly.

We now need to figure out how not to break existing apps.

Should I rebase it against newest version, which allows BC breaks?

We always strive for creating a continuous upgrade path so that there is never a hard BC break. This means e.g. triggering a deprecation notice when applicable, etc.

How can we move forward here?

Since this change could in fact break existing installations, it probably needs to be done in two steps: with deprecation notice first.
Sadly, I simply do not know, how are such situations handled in Symfony.
Alternatively we can do `isset($row['lastUsed']) ? $row['lastUsed'] : $row['lastused']`, like @sstok suggested. But I'm not sure, which makes the best fix...

@nicolas-grekas , Thank you for fixing this. You've found a really clever way!
