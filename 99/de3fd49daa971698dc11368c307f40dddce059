@kbond Still willing to finish this one? I think this is indeed a good idea.

@fabpot sure, I rebased and fixed some CS issues.

One thing I noticed with the animation is it sometimes looks strange - you can see it in the above gif after the "Half way..." message it just alternates between `/` and `\` only. I wonder if we should use some kind of timer to ensure the animation is smooth...?

Anyway, anything that needs to be changed/fixed, let me know.

Tests fail on Windows: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fabpot/symfony/build/1.0.846/job/vcf2cxf0l2wxw52s#L550 , could you help with that?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It can't be from the PR - I haven't added any tests yet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-10-06T16:00:17Z

@kbond Can you add some tests?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kbond at 2015-10-06T18:49:43Z

@fabpot added.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kbond at 2015-10-09T14:05:41Z

I rebased to master. The console component's tests are failing but is unrelated to this PR.

I added a speed trap so the indicator doesn't change more than once per 100 (default) milliseconds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make the indicator immutable, should I remove some public setters? `setFormat`, `setIndicatorChangeInterval`, `setIndicatorValues` could be moved to the constructor. The user could potentially change these values during rendering and that could cause problems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

:+1: for making it immutable; if the list of arguments on the constructor is too large, you can also keep the setter but throw an exception when used after the indicator is started.

I agree with @fabpot. changing the display in the middle does not make much sense to me (and could even cause issues).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kbond at 2015-10-13T15:11:45Z

Ok, I made it immutable and ensured it can be used multiple times per instance.

Unless there are any other changes, this is good to go.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-10-13T15:42:42Z

:+1:

@kbond Looks like the tests on Windows do not pass.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kbond at 2015-10-19T12:23:42Z

Damn, ok I will have a look. It's hard to see what the problem is from the output.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kbond at 2015-10-19T19:21:10Z

Tests on Windows are passing now!
