`??` is more precise than `?:`. With `$foo ?: $bar`, we tell PHP, "Check if `$foo` contains some truthy value and if not, fall back to `$bar` instead". With `$foo ?? $bar`, we explicitly check for `$foo === null` and nothing else.

If possible, we should prefer `??` over `?:` â€“ just as we should prefer `===` over `==`. Less edge cases and the intention of the code is made clearer to the reader.

Moreover, one fine day, when we don't have to support PHP < 7.4 anymore, wen can simplify `$foo = $foo ?? $bar` to `$foo ??= $bar`. ðŸŽ‰
