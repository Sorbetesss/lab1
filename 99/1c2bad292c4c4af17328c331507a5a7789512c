@fabpot Ah OK, you mean like this? https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/48940/commits/88a25758d5a65f8ed430c630e7ffdb0b876a5182

@fabpot sorry I just ammended the commit: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/48940/commits/9c08134769a558074bcb3c5ac20eda57ffd663a4 to have it exactly as you explained. But the fabbot.io action doesn't like the `@param` phpdoc: https://fabbot.io/report/symfony/symfony/48940/9c08134769a558074bcb3c5ac20eda57ffd663a4
I also tried adding the text `parameter not implemented yet` like it's also in other places with commented method arguments, but it still complains ðŸ¤”
