LGTM now. Can you submit another PR for Symfony 2.7 (keep this one open as it's going to be merged as well for more recent versions of Symfony)?

@fabpot, try with cherry-pick but have conflicts. Can i make new PR in 2.7 (arm move changes) and close this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also in 2.7
1. abcent method `Table::setColumnStyle`
2. Use `\InvalidArgumentException` instead `\Symfony\...\InvalidArgumentException`

you should close this one yes, then open a new one against 2.7, then if you'd like another one against the first branch where setColumnStyle exists (and so on).

No, please, don't close this one. @ReenExe You are right, that's why I need a specific PR for 2.7. This one will still be merged for the additional changes. Thanks.

@fabpot, i will try, but conflict stay between branches - it's normal?
In next time first changes make to 2.7 and next in master? (maybe miss some manual from Contributing)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just submit a PR on 2.7 and I will take care of merge conflict myself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make new PR - thats only covers bugfix #19470
