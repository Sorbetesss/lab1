How about  ```if (!(is_file($originFile) || parse_url($originFile, PHP_URL_SCHEME))) { ```?
Because ```$originFile``` is usually a local file, there wonâ€™t be any need to call ```parse_url``` in most cases. I think we should also add a test case to avoid the regression in future. http://symfony.com/robots.txt could be used for that.
