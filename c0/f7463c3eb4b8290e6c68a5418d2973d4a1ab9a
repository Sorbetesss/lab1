I think you also need to do the same changes in `router_prod.php`.

Yes, the behaviour is also wrong in prod environment.

You are right. I have updated the PR.

What needs to be done here?

Isn't this something to be fixed in PHP?

Certainly not. Adjusting the environment variables is done by the rewrite module of your web server. Just look at the existing code:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Resources/config/router_prod.php#L34

`$_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']` is already being adjusted; but since the script is in fact rewriting the URL, `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` and `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` have to be adjusted accordingly, too.

You should change (because of the prod file) the headline of this PR
