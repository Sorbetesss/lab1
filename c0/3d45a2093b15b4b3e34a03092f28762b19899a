Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.4 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

I don't think the two failing tests were caused by this pull request. The 8.0, low deps test complains about `Error: Class "Symfony\Component\Mailer\Header\TagHeader" not found`, which makes no sense. The PHPUnit tests pass on my local machine with PHP 8.

@fabpot Thank you for your suggested changes. I coded it that way because I thought I was following Symfony standards by replicating the way that the [Mailchimp](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.4/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Bridge/Mailchimp/Transport/MandrillApiTransport.php), [Postmark](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.4/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Bridge/Postmark/Transport/PostmarkApiTransport.php), and [Sendinblue](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.4/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Bridge/Sendinblue/Transport/SendinblueApiTransport.php) API transports were coded.
