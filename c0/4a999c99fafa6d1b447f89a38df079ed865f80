@paradajozsef I think the fix is a bit more complex. For example, I do not think that this will solve the issue for the following example too:

```
foo:
    -
        # foobar
        baz: 123
bar:
    -
        # bar
        bar: "123",
```

Can you add it as a test case too?

@xabbuh Sorry for late answer. I added the test case and as always you are right again. :smiley: In this case the line number is 9, but it should be 8. :confused: Still needs work.

@xabbuh I changed the fix. `getNextEmbedBlock` will only skip comment lines, if comments are not in a collection. WDUT?

The above test case passes, failing VarDumper tests unrelated imo.

I apologize to everyone for late answer. (I've been lack of internet at home lately because of moving to another place.)

@stof Thanks for the review. I changed the comment and method name. What about `checkIfPreviousNonCommentLineIsCollectionItem`? It's still kind of wierd imo. Any other ide is very welcome! Thanks!

@paradajozsef Can you please rebase and push again? Looks like Travis otherwise will not run builds for your changes otherwise.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by paradajozsef at 2016-05-06T09:42:52Z

Sure, I can do it tonight.

@xabbuh the reason why Travis does not run tests is because the branch conflicts. As Travis is actually running PR tests on a merge commit rather than on the feature branch, it cannot run them in case of conflicts

Rebase is done, tests are green.
