@javiereguiluz Can you test this one and report?

I've just tested this. I added the changes in `CollectionType.php` ... but it didn't work for me. I tried adding `{% block collection_entry_row %} FOO {% endblock %}` and `{% block collection_entry_widget %} FOO {% endblock %}` in my form theme ... but I don't see any difference. What could I be doing wrong? Thanks.

Thanks for the feedback. That is weird I successfully tried with the Symfony demo app using the `fields.html.twig` yesterday. Are you sure there is not dynamic `_field_name_*` template with precedence?
