The `Converter` name is probably not the best one. I'm not a big fan of `CssToXPathConverter` either and I think the best one is still `CssSelector` (which implements the static interface). Not sure what to do here. ping @symfony/deciders

About the class name: We could merge the `Converter` and the `CssSelector` class and only deprecate the static method.

@xabbuh `toXPath()` are in both the new and the old class (one is static, the other one is not).

@fabpot We could rename the new method to `asXPath()` or something like that or choose a class name like `CssTransformer`.

I think `CssSelector` would be the wrong name for a non-static class. In OOP I would image an API of a CssSelector like `(new CssSelector($css))->toXPath()`. So the CssSelector represents a single css expression. But that is not the API we have here right now. So Converter/Transformer (but more specific) makes alot more sense, as you only need one converter to transform alot of css expressions.

But again just `Converter` is too generic, as I wouldn't know what the purpose of this class is when I see `new Converter()`.

How about any of `CssConverter`, `CssTransformer` or `CssTranslator`?

or `CssSelectorConverter` ?

+1 for `CssSelectorConverter ` as we are converting a selector and not css code

Renamed and fixed the README to use the new API.
