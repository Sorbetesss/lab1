LGTM üëç , but i think the merge should be applied to older maintained branches too

The `421` status code is part of HTTP2 standard. Should we include it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by OskarStark at 2016-04-27T10:45:05Z

If we support HTTP2, then yes

:+1: for 2.3

@nicolas-grekas is it OK to add HTTP2 status codes even if we don't support the HTTP2 protocol?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

But Symfony can already be put behind an HTTP2 server and thus many of us already use it in this context, and we should support it. Maybe a new feature, I don't know what others think. Always hard to know where the limit is :)

@javiereguiluz as far as Symfony is concerned, there is no new protocol here. PHP-FPM talks the FastCGI protocol anyway, not the HTTP one.

So I'm also :+1: for adding this (in 3.1)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@stof OK then. Thanks!  I agree with Nico for merging this in 2.3.

Other changes to the HTTP status list have always been merged in 2.3, so I think we should do the same here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2016-04-27T14:48:14Z

then OK for 2.3
