Could happen, but right now we already call the parent constructor if the container is not compiled. Not doing this for compiled containers leads to inconsistencies and to issues as described in the linked issue.

On the other hand, uncompiled containers are not a thing, so their code path is mostly dead (we even removed it in 4.0.)

Hm indeed, you are right about that. Should we do some reflection then and try to find out if there is a constructor that could be called instead?

Looks great yes. We should ensure that there is a constructor, and that it has zero mandatory args.

On 3.4 only? I'd prefer not change any behavior on 2.*
