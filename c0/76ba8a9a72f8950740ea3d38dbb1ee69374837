This would also "fix" issue #13283 and replaces the reverting PR #13282.

Are we positive Debian has not backported the php fix to their PHP 5.4.4 version? :)

@andrerom Good point. Since the bug does not have a security impact, I doubt that there is a backport. Same with RHEL/CentOS php 5.4.9. But I don't have either distribution as a VM right now to verfiy this.

In general, I'm not a friend of checking against the php version, but I can't see a different way of checking at runtime weather the php distribution is affected or not in this particullar case.

RHEL/CentOS uses 5.4.16 according to [distrowatch](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=redhat)
But your right, they tend to only backport non security fixes if they are fatal error / memory issues.
