should we use 2 static properties for the cache, or an instance property ?

Also, the code may be simpler if we define an instance-level `cache` property, being a reference to either `self::$xmlCache` or `self::$htmlCache`. This way, only the constructor needs to know about the 2 separate caches.

A New crawler is instanced on each method call (for the results). Then each time you call filter() a new css selector converter is instansiated. That's why the cache is static

I will implement your last idea üëç
