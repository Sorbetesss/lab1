What about defining the `E_STRICT` constant in the PHP 5.4 polyfill (or do we already do that?)? Then we could already simplify the code in previous versions.

E_ALL has a different meaning in PHP 5.3 and >= 5.4. That is problem. So we cannot do anything in Polyfill.

@Tobion I see, but then treating `-1` now like `E_ALL` could become tricky in the future (see my inline comment), couldn't it?

Since PHP 7 introduced exceptions in the core, I seriously doubt that any new `E_*` will ever be introduced.
