@symfony/deciders should we merge this in 2.7, or should we consider it a new feature ?

For reference, the automatic detection of Mintty was backported  to 2.3 in the past (see #15915), so merging in 2.7 looks fine.

For 2.7: infrastructure-related changes are bug fixes (similarly to PR fixing issues with newer versions of PHP)

travis ci fails due to [an issue](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/builds/335161356) on the base branch, I'll rebase these changes when it has been fixed if necessary.
