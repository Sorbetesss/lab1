Such renaming makes sense to me

@Nyholm Why did you revert the service renaming?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the tests was failing all over the place. :(

The `limiter` service is abstract and all our `LimiterInterface` services uses that abstract service. They are created with names `limiter.acme`. Where `acme` is just the thing added to exiting service. So they would be named `limiter_factory.acme`.

I tried searching for all references in other components and fixing the issue but I couldn't really. I can try an another search if you want.

Works for me as-is. Thanks for explaining :)
