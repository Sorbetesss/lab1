The title should be only for the text format IMO

There is no text format. The default is `yaml` and it hasn't been parsable ever since. Now in 6.3, there's a new fallback to `json` in case the Yaml component is not installed. But there is also a new `--format` option.

then maybe the title should be removed or be an info written to stderr instead of stdout

I don't really see any value in the title either but I don't feel like I'm in charge to decide on this ðŸ˜„

maybe show title if --format is not given

or put different, the default format can be new `text` which shows title+yaml, but --format=yaml shows no title
