Side note : I noticed `Symfony\Component\ErrorHandler\ErrorHandler::getErrorEnhancers()` feature is not used with the "new" system with the ErrorRendered.

Should I open a new issue to wire it?

I'll look at it for the enhancers. Which branch should I target?

6.4 I suppose as that's more an improvement than a bugfix.
