I think I'm against being that broad. Conceptually, an argument can only be `string|string[]` and an option `string|string[]|bool`. In any case, adding support for more is not a bug fix, so not for 2.8.

Note: it's not because something happens to work that we should make it official. That's one of these case IMHO

@fabpot thank you for your reply, I see your point (the original proposal was exactly that "strict"). There was a reason behind the inclusion of any object implementing `__toString()`, but I understand that it might be too broad and lead to misunderstandings and unpredictable behaviors. (I think that some explicit casts won't hurt)

May I change the doc as you suggested or should I wait for further investigation?

I think you can go ahead and make the changes.
