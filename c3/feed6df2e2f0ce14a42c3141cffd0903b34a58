@DraCzris What's turbolinks? It looks like a ruby on rails feature? Is it something else? How does it relate to Symfony?

Thanks!

I'm not a big fan of adding things that seems very specific and not widespread/standard.

What do we do here? I can see two options here: merge as is or close it (I'm not a big fan of adding yet another configuration point.)
