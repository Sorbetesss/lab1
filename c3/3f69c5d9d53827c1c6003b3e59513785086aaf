That's a new feature to me, it should target master.
Also please add some test cases.

Changed target branch to master and added unit tests.

this should indeed target master, as it will require the same kind of changes in any other code dealing with the same convention for translation resources (this will affect https://github.com/willdurand/BazingaJsTranslationBundle for instance). So we should not merge this as a bugfix.

Is there anything else I need to do in order to get this PR merged? :-)
