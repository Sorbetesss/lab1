@dunglas does this approach make sense? and would you have an idea what i got wrong with the service configuration?

Hey!

I think @mtarld has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

I've cherry-picked the changes on JsonEncoder in c693778940f379edf42272018cf8984e217befeb, on top of #45554, branch 5.4

I've updated the patch attached to this PR to keep only the part related to YamlEncoder.
This would be a new feature so it should target 6.2

I'll let you update the PR description if you don't mind, also add tests and a line in the changelog of the component?

thanks. i rebased on 6.2 and updated the commit.

i think the build errors are not related to my change but broken in the 6.2 branch.
