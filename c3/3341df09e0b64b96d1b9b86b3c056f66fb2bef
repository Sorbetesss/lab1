:+1: nice and fast, yeah the only fail is because of the country `Burkina Faso` which is a valid name and not a typo

I think the bot should run on the diff rather than on the whole file.

Sorry but this will not cut it unless you implement a registry like this https://code.google.com/p/php-iban/source/browse/trunk/php-iban.php and implement all the edge cases to truly validate an iban number. This is almost on the same lines as the email validator, that it can get out of control pretty easily :baby: ready for the road @stewe ? :baby:

Well, that's a bit huge for me at the moment :)
Maybe we can merge this and open a new issue to work on a registry.

is very well written, almost a port one to one but not sure about if the license is a problem @fabpot ping any thoughts?

LGPL can not be sub licensed (unlike MIT) so you must ask permission from the author(s) to change the license.

merging this one as implementing a full IBAN validator is probably out of the scope of this PR anyway.
