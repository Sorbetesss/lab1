Is it not a duplicate?

@hhamon There were previous attempts like #12889 which did more than the changes here (they tried to fix  #10054 which is similar but not the same as it seems).

This only prevents an exception. It doesn't really fix the root cause as the type won't be shown. I still think it should be merged.
