Sorry, I'm late in the game here, but what is the rationale behind doing a BC break in 7.1?

Hey Fabien, we published this as a BC break because technically it is (we changed the behavior of the `import()` method under certain context/scope without deprecation path). However, actually, nobody can/should use the `import()` method in the `prependExtension()` because it's defective, appending config instead of prepending. That's why we were using the `ContainerBuilder::prependExtensionConfig()` until now (which is limited to an `array` of config).

Honestly, this BC break, in the end, doesn't feel like a real BC break to me, as the previous behavior was faulty and unwanted. However, it applies to the BC break rules, so we are documenting it as such.

More details can be found here https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/52789 and here https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/52843

Hope it's ok for youðŸ¤ž

Thank you for the clear explanation, that makes sense to me now.
