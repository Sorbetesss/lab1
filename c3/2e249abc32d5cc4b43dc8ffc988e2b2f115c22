Not sure if I should fix the fail check for code I didn't touch ?

@xabbuh Should I fix the CI ? The error (even from fabbot.io) seems unrelated to my changes, and I'm affraid about conflict during futur merge if I start fixing them...

@VincentLanglet You can safely ignore things suggested by fabbot that haven't been touched by your changes.
