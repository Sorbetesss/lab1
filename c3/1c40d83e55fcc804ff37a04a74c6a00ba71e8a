@ostrolucky you're right. I'll also add a constructor option.

@ostrolucky done

I also widened the visibility of `$maxDepthHandler` to protected, for consistency.

Last commit has been reverted, after discussing with @nicolas-grekas we had a better idea: we'll introduce soon an option to be able to easily set a default context.

We just talked with @dunglas on Slack: he's going to make another PR that will provide a `$contextDefaults` argument to the constructor, instead of any added setter or extra argument.
