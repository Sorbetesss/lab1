Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.x branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

To make the CI pass we also need to add the Uid component to the `require-dev` section of the Form component. ~Can you please also add entries to the component's changelog?~

@xabbuh I added `"symfony/uid": "^5.1"` to the require-dev section.

@nicolas-grekas should we have separate `UlidType` and `UuidType` or a single `UidType` ?

I think I prefer to have them split into two types, but I don't have a strong opinion about this.

My feeling has that having two distinct types makes it easier for users to discover how to use the form types (i.e. they can use them without the need to pass any options).
