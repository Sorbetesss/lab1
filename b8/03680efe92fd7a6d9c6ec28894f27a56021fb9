I've updated the code to check for errors during the search of free.

LGTM. Just 2 comments regarding style, so it is consistent with the rest.

I've updated the spacing.

By the way, could you add a few functional tests?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've added a `find` test and a few for checking the (new) exceptions.

I hope the Travis test-config is correct (taken from the `master` branch), I do not have a lot of experience in that area.

Nevermind my comment.

I thought you were in the `master` branch. Could you revert the last commit, then squash your all your commits in a single one? Thanks!

While we could add functional tests, these will most likely break when merging back to the `master` branch.

Yes, reverted last commits.
