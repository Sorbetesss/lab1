Hey!

I think @HeahDude has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Hello @xabbuh, do you think there is any chance that this gets merged? I would like to close it if there is no chance. Thanks for any answer.

@michaelKaefer This sounds reasonable to me.

@xabbuh Do you mean the PR sounds reasonable or closing the PR sounds reasonable?

Can you please add a test case, and also a line in the changelog of the component?

@nicolas-grekas Sorry, I forgot that, I added both now.
