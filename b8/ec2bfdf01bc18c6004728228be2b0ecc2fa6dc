Discussed exactly that in the origin PR with fabpot

I was confused by this PR until I realised that I misread the blog example. I thought `flush` sent the buffer and then cleared it, similar to PHP's `ob_flush`.

Both PHP and fabpot's usage of the word is correct, to flush is to send something down a path, typically to cleanse.

So with that ambiguity and PHP precedence, wouldn't it be more concise to go with `clear`?
