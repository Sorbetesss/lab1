@nicolas-grekas Ready for review.

The bug has been fixed upstream, let's try again? Can you rerun the tests see if they pass now?

Oh, would you mind doing a benchmark too? I'd be happy to know if the new way works faster than the current one.

In theory, this should work, in practice, tests fail.
Waiting for feedback on https://bugs.php.net/78263
Could you please add a test case with a typed property that works by reference meanwhile?
