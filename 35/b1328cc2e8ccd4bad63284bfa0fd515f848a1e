Yes. I tested Travis config on my own bundles, and `php7.4` worked there, CI passed. But I didn't notice that symfony uses different dist `dist: trusty`.

For this dist `php7.4` is still not available. Missing file https://storage.googleapis.com/travis-ci-language-archives/php/binaries/ubuntu/14.04/x86_64/php-7.4.tar.bz2

But for Ubunty 16.04 it is already there https://storage.googleapis.com/travis-ci-language-archives/php/binaries/ubuntu/16.04/x86_64/php-7.4.tar.bz2

Add `dist: xenial` in this job

this won't work, because xenial does not have PHP 5.5
