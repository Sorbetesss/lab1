Sorry for asking. But why can't we just add a logger to the FakeSMS transport?

In this case one need to configure the email stuff just to get the logging.

If you have no mailing in your project, you would need to set it up just for local dev to have the entry point via DSN

@OskarStark

PR rebased, also on

> Please add a test case to UnsupportedSchemeExceptionTest

I am sorry I really do not understand this, when I check into this class Notifier\UnsupportedSchemeExceptionTest, I already see logic on `FakeSmsTransportFactory`

can you be more precise on the way to do the required test? thank you

edit: appveyor failure is not related to this addition

You are right, it is just a new transport for an existing bridge üëç
