@nicolas-grekas I specifically mentioned professional translator, because I actually work with one. I can provide a proof of that if necessary. When I had a native speaker available, I mentioned it explicitly.

OK, great. I'm surprised you're able to deliver so many languages at this rate.
On my side, the constant stream of PRs on the topic is a burden I'd like to cut, so there is my proposal.
I'd be happy to have reviews on GPT-generated translations instead!

Hi Nicolas, I was always explicit in my PRs about where the translations come from. I saw that maybe I'll be able to help quicker so I contacted a company and ordered those translations - all of them were made by native speakers or sworn translators, I have asked for that. Since they were ready today, I submitted all PRs. I didn't assign myself until they were ready, to not block anyone who would like to contribute. Would it be possible for you to merge my PRs once I rebase them?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, I can do that. If you have more patches on the topic, it'd be nice if you could group them in one PR also. :pray:

@nicolas-grekas excellent, I'll rebase them shortly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@nicolas-grekas all PRs rebased, checked diffs and they update only the `<target>` line removing the `needs-translation` attribute. I will group the changes next time for all translations I have available at given time, I'm sorry for causing additional work. I thought that one-PR-per-issue is expected since @carsonbot raised separate issues.

PR rebased and ready.

@nicolas-grekas what do you think of having a list of native speakers, ready to review such messages, which could then get a ping after ChatGPT proposed a translation?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2024-01-05T07:02:34Z

@OskarStark we would need a way to manage that list. And since things should remain open, people should be able to subscribe and unsubscribe at will.

One idea in this direction could be to have one special issue managed by carsbonbot that is opened/closed when needed, and that people could register to to be notified of when a new translation is needed. Or maybe one issue per language (but I'm not sure this is a good idea as that'd also mean spamming notifications - one single issue wouldn't). @Nyholm WDYT also?

~Oh, another idea would be to add willing translators to .github/CODEOWNER~

@nicolas-grekas I volunteer as tribute for Polish. :smile:

That wouldn't work, I already had that idea for bridges in Notifier, Mailer etc. but this file only has some effect for members of the repo/orga ðŸ˜¢

> In order to still allow and call for human review, I propose to use the `state="needs-review-translation"` on `<target>` tags as defined by XLIFF.

WDYT of using `state="needs-review"` since the translation is already done by GPT and it just needs to be reviewed?

It's not in the xliff spec: https://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#state
