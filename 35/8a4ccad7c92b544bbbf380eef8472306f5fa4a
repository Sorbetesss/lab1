The fact that it does not change the Configuration class looks weird to me

@stof ``canBeEnabled`` is used in the ``Configuration`` so it's ok. In fact it's possible that this was broken, i'll run some checks.

@stof ok in fact the ``$this->isConfigEnabled()`` is inside the ``register*`` functions.
Anyway this still looks inconsistent to me, imo we should move this checks to the main function, wdyt?

At least, I would now remove the second call to the `isConfigEnabled()` method inside `registerSerializerConfiguration()` and `registerPropertyInfoConfiguration()`.
