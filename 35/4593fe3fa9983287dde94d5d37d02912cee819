What about creating a generic way of allowing custom masks in here? I think it would be very nice to add custom filters here for certain sensitive data (.env maybe?).

What if we change the parameter name using `password_parameter` setting in the `security.yml` file?

What if you have passwords or other sensitive data in one of your variables? You will keep adding exceptions to this list
