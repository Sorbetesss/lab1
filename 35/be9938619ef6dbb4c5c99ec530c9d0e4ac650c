I'm afraid that @xabbuh is already trying to fix this issue in #18028. Maybe you can join forces?

@javiereguiluz yeah I know but as @stof said https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/18028#issuecomment-196449943, @xabbuh can't use a black list without this :-/

Thanks for taking care of this @Ener-Getick! I like the approach in general and just left some suggestions to improve it a bit.

there is a another nice side-effect of this PR: ``Container::camelize`` can generate the same output for several service ids (due to method name being case insensitive), so this could allow fixing this case too

I updated the ``ProxyDumper`` as the method name was hardcoded.

@trousers this issues aren't related to this PR as there were already present.
