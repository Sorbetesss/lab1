I would stick to full names here. We already use ``map`` and ``list`` which are not names of PHP types either

I also prefer the full names.

üëç I agree with @xabbuh here. `int` and `bool` are the only future-proof values according to PHP. If we use the same values in PHP and in this XML thing, people won't have to think what to use, so the learning curve will be lower.

:+1: since I tend to agree for the short version also because of PHP types

Will this is not break for people that are already using this? It seems the XSD is updated, but no longer supports the other tags.

@sstok if you follow the linked PR you'll see that this feature was just merged before.

Hihi üòÑ I looked at the initial date, not the date of the merge üòä

I'm üëç on the full names, it's also what is used in the DependencyInjection XML schema.

So, there is no consensus. What do we do? I don't care that much, so this PR is üëç for me.

@xabbuh Can you finish this one so that we can merge it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fabpot done
