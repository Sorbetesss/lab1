@jderusse Shall we close then? Should we also close #35350?

#37590 partially fixes this issue. StoreFactory still does not support the same exact DSN syntax as Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\AbstractAdapter for Redis connections.

But this PR can be closed if we do not want to allow DSN with multiple Redis hosts for Locks.

You're right @Jontsa.

Can you, please, rebase your PR and keep the part about DSN pattern?

@Jontsa Do you time to finish this PR?

@Jontsa I think you will need to rebase on the current 4.4 branch as there are some conflicts.
