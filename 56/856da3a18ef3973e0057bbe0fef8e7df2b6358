this was never necessary AFAICT. It looks like a mistake by trying make it parallel to AppKernel extending the Symfony class, while there was actually nothing to implement in AppCache from day one.

However, this class has a typehinting issue in the constructor. It typehints HttpKernelInterface, but the implementation actually expects a KernelInterface (which has much more methods)

So is it a bug fix ?
Should I also fix the type-hint ?

lets' make it a bug fix and fix the type hint?

I'm confused: is this a bug fix or a new feature? The branch is `2.7` but the milestone is `4.1.`. Also, just asking: won't this need any change at all in end-users code in any case? If yes, we'd need a note in the UPGRADE file.

@javiereguiluz I updated the PR to be a "bug fix" as requested. Indeed the milestone should be changes.

And this change does not require any change in end-users code.
