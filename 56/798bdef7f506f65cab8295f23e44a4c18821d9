Is there anything "breaking" if the user now switch to the "new" logic?

As it's already broken for all projects without the asset alias "name", I don't think so. And for all others projects with this asset alias, I made the check of the prefix key to check if the key starts with the domain name or not.

To be sure, I will made a test project with and without assay alias and process some tests, I'll let you know.
