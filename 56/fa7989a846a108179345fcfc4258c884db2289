Note to merger: to revert in 3.0

Why is the order of the attributes important? Imo you should not rely on it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-03-23T14:06:54Z

@xabbuh we don't have the choice IMHO.

The component themes need to print the value independently from `attr` so they can be overridden with:
```twig
{% set read_only = true %}
{{ block('parent_block') }}
```

:+1: however I think the tests need to be reverted too to ensure that we are fixing the problem (see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/14403#discussion_r57133978)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@mnapoli Thanks for the review, the tests are already reverted (otherwise they would fail).

Failures are unrelated.

You will now need to update the lowest version of the Form component required by the FrameworkBundle to `^2.8.4`.

@xabbuh so it should be done in a second commit since this one is supposed to be reverted in 3.0, right ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2016-03-25T18:21:01Z

Not necessarily if I don't misunderstand you. We need to revert all the changes here in the `3.0` branch, don't we?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-03-25T18:22:18Z

Yes we do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-03-25T18:45:01Z

Thanks @xabbuh tests are all green now (excepted appveyor being unusually long).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-03-25T19:38:56Z

It seems appveyor has bugged, why does it still try to install icu v51 ?

Status: Reviewed

by HeahDude at 2016-03-26T16:43:02Z

@xabbuh Do I need to upgrade the `composer.json` of `TwigBridge` too ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2016-03-26T18:48:38Z

@HeahDude Usually you would have to do that. But this time that's not necessary as this was apparently done in another pull request before: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.8/src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/composer.json#L25

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by HeahDude at 2016-03-26T18:51:01Z

@xabbuh Thanks for your leading :)
