It only reduces the BC break. It doesn't fully return BC. There are still BC breaks. For example when you don't have a default for the parameter but one in the method signature. It can match totally different routes.
The only way to return BC would be to remove the feature. The other option would be to document the bc break.

@Tobion I think that this is best way for now (reduce BC), as I can't find (without removing this feature) full BC compatibility fix (at least now) and add to docs note about the missing BC.

@fabpot what do you think about this?
