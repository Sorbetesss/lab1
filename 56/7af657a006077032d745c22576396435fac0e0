This is good for saving toolbar space.
BTW, you should squash your commits.

@phansys The commits will be squashed latest once the PR is being merged, this is part of the `gh` toolchain Fabien showed once.

I've thought in the whole change as a single one, but you're right if you are trying to  track each change individually. Thank you for the clarification, I didn't know about the toolchain.

@phansys Once it is being merged it will be squashed into one commit if you have not squashed it before in order to maintain a clean history
