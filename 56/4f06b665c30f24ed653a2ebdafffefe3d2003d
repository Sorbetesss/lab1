It's also a matter of maintaining the theme. Any @symfony/deciders willing to maintain it. Personally, I'm :-1:

I'd :+1: as I believe Foundation is a better base for custom apps (more neutral default theme, less override rules needed in the CSS to achieve a custom look) while Bootstrap is better geared at rapid prototyping and I'd argue Symfony is probably still better at building sustainable custom apps than prototypes.

The whitespace control is missing in this template to remove extra spaces (as done in the default theme)

@totophe Any news on this PR? Are you willing to finish it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by totophe at 2015-02-10T08:19:34Z

Yes, sorry, I was drawn into our sprints. I'll do that ASAP.

Hi, changes are made. Sorry @stof for the delay. I'll not procrastinate next time.

Would have saved me a some time had this been in the Twig bundle... Thank you!

@totophe could you open a doc PR (see this one for the bootstrap theme: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4411)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2015-06-20T15:56:08Z

:+1: with some comments above

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by totophe at 2015-06-22T12:40:51Z

@nicolas-grekas I'll fix that asap (this week)

To be consistent with our Bootstrap practice and to be future-proof, we should probably rename the Twig template to `foundation_5_layout.html.twig`

Here you go

Foundation is interesting and it looks like a good idea to have support for it in Symfony but as I don't often use it and will not help to maintain this theme I prefer abstention.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am neither pro nor contra. The implementation looks good, but it would be good to have someone being able to maintain the theme. On the other hand, a form theme is not a real big deal and could probably live in the core nonetheless.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-09-25T12:00:42Z

ok, let's merge it in 2.8. If we have too many bug reports and noone fixing them, we will still be able to deprecate it and remove it later on.
