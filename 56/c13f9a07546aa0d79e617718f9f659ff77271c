I had to use fully qualified names because you can't have an alias name which is equal to an existing class.

The other failing tests in 5.3.* are not caused by this PR.

Apart from the mentioned issues, this looks good. Could you please rebase and make the suggested changes?

@bschussek I fixed/did the suggested changes, updated the doc PR and rebased it. I think it's ready to merge now.
