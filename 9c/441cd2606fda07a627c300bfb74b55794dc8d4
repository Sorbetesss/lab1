I _think_ all the failures are Mime related

@nicolas-grekas Used _windows-only_ method to test exception & came back to simpler (not test-related) code in the RemotePackageStorage file

AppVeyor had a problem during AssetMapper tests ..

```
Testing C:\projects\symfony\src\Symfony\Component\AssetMapper
.
Fatal error: Out of memory (allocated 1879048192 bytes) (tried to allocate 262144 bytes) in C:\projects\symfony\src\Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder.php on line 1747
```

Can we re-run them to see ?

Unit tests failures unrelated (AssetMapper ones pass)
