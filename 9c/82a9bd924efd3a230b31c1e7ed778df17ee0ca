A bug fix usually goes into the lowest possible maintained branch, can this go into 2.7?

@Imangazaliev you should also rebase your commit on the 2.7 branch in git and (force) push your branch from there.

And perhaps add a little test? :angel:

As you created your PR from your master branch directly, rebasing it elsewhere will mess your fork though. this is why using feature branches is better.

And btw, when opening the PR, it is good to explain what the bug being fixed is instead of saying ``bug fixed``
