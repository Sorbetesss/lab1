On second thought: Those reserved characters are not implementation-specific, right? Maybe we could add them to the contracts' `CacheItemInterface` instead?

On `ItemInterface` in contracts, good idea.
Don't miss bumping the minimum version of the cache-contracts to `^1.1.7` for the component.

@nicolas-grekas Could you confirm you are saying I should change the following:

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/f0aff8c4d58d71b769045bdc2cec1cfbb1d3207e/src/Symfony/Component/Cache/composer.json#L27

To this:

```json
"symfony/cache-contracts": "^1.1.7|^2",
```

The constant has been moved to `ItemInterface` and composer.json has been updated to bump the cache-contracts minimum version.
