Just to be sure: this matters only when strict types are enabled, right? Looking at the `@param` in the interface, I'd say we might have forgotten to change the type there in 7.0. Let's do it on 7.0 as a bugfix?

Indeed! It works as-is when strict types are disabled. I guess we have to wait for the next major to update the interface, even if it's a bug?

Ah no sorry, the change was fine for 6.4.
For 7.0, that'd be on the interface.
We might want to check other `@param` in case we forgot to update a few others. Not sure how.

Got back to 6.4. üëç

I think this is something that may be doable with some custom PHPStan rule? I didn't play with this yet, that's an interesting case. I'll try something when I have some time.
