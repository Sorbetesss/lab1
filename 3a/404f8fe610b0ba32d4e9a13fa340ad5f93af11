@Zzortell Could you please also rebase and add a test for this feature?

I integrate this commit in #14420 so you can close this one.

@Zzortell These are separate things. I think there should be two PRs. It's easier to review this way.

@xabbuh What do you mean when you say rebase ? Because I rebased it when I pushed it

@Zzortell Never mind, I must have looked at the wrong Travis build. So everything is fine. :+1:

Travais failed because of errors in Process and Debug components. Nothing to do with this PR. Let's merge !
