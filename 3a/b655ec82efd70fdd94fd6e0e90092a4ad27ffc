@nicolas-grekas Is there any way, besides pushing changes, to retrigger the builds? I don't see how the failing test is related to my changes.

@Basster can you rebase (and squash meanwhile if you want) please so that the merge commit disappears?

> Moderators earlier asked you to "squash" your commits. This means you will convert many commits to one commit. This is no longer necessary today, because Symfony project uses a proprietary tool which automatically squashes all commits before merging.

From https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html, should I do so, anyways?

Not if you don't want :)

But rebasing is needed as there is a conflict.

@Basster would you have some time to rebase before the end of the week?

@nicolas-grekas *done* (hopefully correct)
