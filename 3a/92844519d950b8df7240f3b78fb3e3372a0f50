Simple question. If serialize will be added, why not unserialize too?

Second question: why only objects we can serialize?

~For the travis failure:~
```
1) Symfony\Bridge\Twig\Tests\Extension\SerializerExtensionTest::testContextPassedToSerializer

Twig\Error\RuntimeError: An exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template ("[Semantical Error] The annotation "@Groups" in property Symfony\Bridge\Twig\Tests\Fixtures\extension\SerializerModelFixture::$name was never imported. Did you maybe forget to add a "use" statement for this annotation?") in "template" at line 1.
```
~Am I missing something obvious?~
`doctrine/annotations` dev dependency version constraint was to low for PHP8
