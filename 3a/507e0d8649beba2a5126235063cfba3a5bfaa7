First of... please fix [Coding Standards](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html) to match Symfony2. =)

Thanks for your feedback. I updated the code and hope things are ok now.

In french (fr_FR) it's "Le numÃ©ro IBAN saisi n'est pas valide (International Bank Account Number)."

Updated!
Any ideas why PHPStorm keeps messing with my indentation levels after saving a file?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stloyd at 2013-01-11T10:52:08Z

@sprain You can use in PHPStrom: `Edit -> Convert Indents -> To Spaces` if it won't help you should change settings: `File -> Settings -> Code Style -> General (or PHP)` and turn of "Use tab character".

Thank you for this implementation! Could you please add tests for the null and empty string cases? (see the other validator tests)

Also, as was said, please fix the indentation.

@AAtticus Thanks, that's the plan but it would be nice if I wouldn't have to add an extra bundle as they impact speed and memory usage :)
