I find it confusing: my original assumption would have been that the other arguments are other messages, in case I want to dispatch multiple of them at the same time. I know it's been done this way on `Envelope::__constructor` but looking back, I'm not convinced.

This is much more explicit:
```php
$bus->dispatch(
   new Envelope(new SendSmsNotification('Hi!'))
       ->with(new DelayStamp(10), new QueueNameStamp('low'))
);
```

Or if it's *really* important, let's make it an array so we identify easily that it should not be other messages?
```php
$bus->dispatch(
   new SendSmsNotification('Hi!'),
   [ new DelayStamp(10), new QueueNameStamp('low') ]
);
```

Hmm, fair point. Wrapping it in an array still looks great to me, and indeed, a bit more clear. I can change to use that if others agree.

I agree that using an array. looks a bit better.

I suggest we change the `Envelope::__construct` 2nd argument as well.

This is ready to go:

* 2nd arg added to MessageBusInterface: `array $stamps = []`
* "2nd" arg on `Envelope` changed from `StampInterface ...$stamps` to `array $stamps = []`
