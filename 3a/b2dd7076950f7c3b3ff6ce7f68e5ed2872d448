Anyway, this is new feature and it can't go to `2.3` & `2.4` versions.

Iâ€™d definitely use it.

@webmozart - I've made the changes you suggested and squashed them into the original commit.

@ddebernardy - I added a new constraint option named `strict`. When `true` (default), only UUIDs matching the RFC's format are allowed.  Setting this to `false` will allow those non-standard values which other systems like PostgreSQL accept.  You'll find this change in commit 7c0c462.  **Edit:** The version and variant are only validated in strict mode.

Thank you both for your feedback and suggestions!

Looks good, but I haven't verified the algorithm against the RFC. @ddebernardy (or anyone else with experience in UUID processing) do you have any further comments?

:-1: this is too specific and it shouldn't be included in the core. Please move it to a community bundle.

Don't worry. I'm just kidding :smile:  Whenever I propose something new for Symfony people keep telling me that and for once, I wanted to know how it feels to say it.

I like this new validator. Thank you very much @colinodell for adding it.

I've created a PR for the new documentation that accompanies this feature: symfony/symfony-docs#3619

@webmozart, what are the next steps?  Is there anything else you need from me, or are we just waiting on feedback?

@fabpot What do you think about this (skipping the wrong branch this is opened against =))
