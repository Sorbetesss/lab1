IMHO, if we can remove the deprecation, go for 3.1, otherwise, master.

@nicolas-grekas alright, re-opening against the master, I can't avoid the argument it seems

Reopened after removing BC break of #19785

Isn't it something that also needs to fixed on 2.7?

@fabpot in the controller resolver, yes. Probably in the argument resolver as well (but would like to do that in another patch) Once it's fixed in here, I can probably backport a similar solution

@iltar If possible, I would prefer to have the 2.7 patch so that we can merge it first, merge 2.7 into 2.8 then 3.1, and merge this PR immediately to resolve conflicts.

@fabpot sounds like a plan, I'll get it ready when I have some extra time
