You have update the minimum version required for the PropertyAccess component in the `require-dev` section to be `~3.1`.

@xabbuh it should work with any supported PropertyAccess version as #18210 has been merged in 2.3. Maybe should I add a `conflict` section however.

:+1: for 3.1. The composer.json update is fine to me.
