One of the goal of displaying the token is to be able to copy/paste it. So, a better fix would be to just get the first 6 characters of the `sha1` in the Profiler class instead.

:+1: for using the first 6 characters (or make the hash a copy button to copy the sha1, but that would be hard to make'

Yes, I thought that and it still can be copied right from this popover:

Or it's not convenient enough?

Let's keep it simple: limiting the sha1 to the first 6 chars is good enough.
