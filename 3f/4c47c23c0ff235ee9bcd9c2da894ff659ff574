I guess fabbot failure (unrelated) should be fixed from `2.7`

Should we merge this one as a bugfix into the `3.3` branch instead?

As a bugfix should be into `2.7`, no? Let's me know the final decision. I'm for a bugfix rather than a feature ( similar to https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/24115)

As env vars are "officially" supported since 3.3, I'd vote for a merge in 3.3

Done.
