While writing github webhook request parser I encountered that they send signature as a header, would it make sense to also add `HeaderRequestMatcher` to core?

That would be a big yes for me, definitely! Gave a try here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/51343

Thank you for the idea, it would be even more powerful with those features!
