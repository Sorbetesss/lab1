I don't like the comments. PR templates should be templates. Contributing guidelines should be described in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or the Symfony Contribution Guide in the docs.

If it turns out people don't read that doc, simply adding a small link to it seems better than duplicating contributing guidelines in so many places imo.

that is already proven, and I suggest trying with a comment here instead, see if it makes things better.

I like @wouterj suggestion to add a link to the CONTRIBUTOR guide.

The link to contributing is already there in the UI:
