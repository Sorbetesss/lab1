the question is how it is possible to have these non-existent keys in the output of `debug_backtrace`

Also if it is possible, we should probably not just fallback to null here, it may have other impacts on this code path.

it is, PHP inserts virtual frames in a few cases (can't remember exactly which ones)

I have been trying to reproduce the error today to provide more context but I haven't be able to reproduce it yet.
