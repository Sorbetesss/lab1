Could it be possible to add a test case that covers the situation you describe, ie that uses a union type?

@nicolas-grekas I think this tests the union type with a failure first: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.4/src/Symfony/Component/Serializer/Tests/SerializerTest.php#L740

But it won't test _every_ normalizer for throwing the correct exception.

And secondly the `DateIntervalNormalizerTest` now does assert the exception is thrown for this normalizer.

@nicolas-grekas Sure, I'll take a look sometime today.
