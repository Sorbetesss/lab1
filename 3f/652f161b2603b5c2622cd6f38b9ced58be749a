IIRC, I think that the web profiler was compatible with right to left. Isn't the case anymore?

Hello @fabpot .
Thanks for reviewing.

It should not follow the right-to-left style because it's not interesting to display it.
It's best to stay with left-to-right.

Your screenshot looks like the default page should be fixed as well. ðŸ‘€
