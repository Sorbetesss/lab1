Failure is related, I need to investigate.

@nicolas-grekas The failure is related to the PHP version. It seems that the destructor of `ErrorChunk` is not triggered in the same way on 7.2 and above, I don't really know what should I do here. Keep the current behavior (direct throw) on 7.2? Modify the test so that it doesn't rely on the destructor? Something else?
