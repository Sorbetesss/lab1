Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.1" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.4".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Could you update the PR title to describe the bug fix?

Please add a test covering the conversion of a payload that has no tags, to prevent regressions.

Just added a test case where there are no tag in the payload, but I only did it for one event type "request".

 What do you think @stof , should I change the existing test cases to add the no tags variation for them also?
 I think it's not needed, because the tags checking condition is common for each event type.
