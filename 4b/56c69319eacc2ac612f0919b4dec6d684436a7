This should be merged whenever it is ready on Travis (see http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-04-28-upcoming-build-environment-updates/).

why didn't you changed line 9 ? what about using hhvm and hhvm-nightly together ?

Running the current stable is not needed as recent versions of HHM fix so many problems in Symfony. So, as I said, we will add the stable version whenever HHVM runs Symfony smoothly.

you forgot to update the line 9. you allow failure on hhvm-nightly, but you run on hhvm stable without allowing it to fail
