Could you please rebase and squash the PR?

@nicolas-grekas i've done the rebase and now fabbot says "code looks good" (and the conflict came back).

To fix the conflict, you need to 1. fetch the upstream symfony/symfony repo 2. rebase on the 5.x branch of this repo. Please also squash so that the PR contains only one commit (or two if there are two authors).
