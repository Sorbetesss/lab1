This makes sense to me.
Other traceable decorators don't have such a high priority except the `TraceableValidator`. Here is the rationale: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22554#discussion_r116217802 (tl;dr: it's for extra safety, but as said above the result is surprising).
/cc @ogizanagi I think the same fix should apply to the `TraceableValidator`.

Hmm, re-reading this, would make sense to make the traceable decorator last indeed… but since we don't have any unexpected report for this yet, perhaps keep this status-quo for the validator one. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Indeed, I think that decorating a validator isn't a common use case (I think almost nobody tried it).
That being said, the Validator decoration priority isn't valid IMHO, maybe it should be updated?

I agree, let's keep it as-is as long as nobody actually complains (from my experience that kind of bugfixes in old versions is source of problems/anger -_-)
