Friendly ping @dunglas @soyuka as this small change would actually affect ApiPlatform's [DocumentNormalizer](https://github.com/api-platform/core/blob/ccef472cade42b189fa8cb7793e27fad1349e289/src/Elasticsearch/Serializer/DocumentNormalizer.php#L24)
Looks to me like ApiPlatform could go with decoration instead?

Indeed IMO this is a mistake from us, we should've used the AbstractObjectNormalizer instead. :+1: on making this class final!
