the package name should be ``symfony/propel1-bridge`` actually, as it is the current name.

and I think you should start by submitting a PR to PropelBundle to add this requirement in all branches (it won't hurt yet because the bridge package already exists). This way, PropelBundle users would get it out of the box.

And finally, you need to remove the ``replace`` rule in the root composer.json as symfony/symfony does not contain the propel bridge anymore.
