Why didn't we go with the option of adding the argument to the existing interface, with a proper BC layer? It would make sense to me, don't you think so?

Replacing the concrete method by a virtual one until 6.0? Our BC promise needs a patch :)

@chalasr no need: just adding an `@param` annotation is enough, alongside with:
- a commented argument on the signature,
- all implementations updated accordingly (in a similar way for non-final/internal classes)
- notes in UPGRADE-5.1/6.0.md + CHANGELOG

@Braxilior up to do it ?

@chalasr i do think the BC promise needs a patch in general. See https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/issues/10504 for reference :)
