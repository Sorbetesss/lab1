This PR should target the 4.4 branch. If you only add a `@method` annotation to the `BundleInterface` instead of the real method, it's not a BC break anymore.

So, should I close this PR and open another one on 4.4?

@garak No, you change the target of this PR without creating a new one.

@fabpot I just tried to change target to 4.4. and a bunch of stuff popped up.
Maybe a new PR is a better option... unless you can suggest a way to get rid of such mess
Thanks

@garak rebase your PR locally on 4.4 and push again, that should resolve the mess.

I rebased upon 4.4.
I followed suggestion from @derrabus and replaced actual method with an annotation inside interface.
I also updated initial PR comment.

Hope everything is fine

I still see "Status: Needs Work" label. Should I do something else?

Friendly reminder: did needed work, do I need to do some more?

I addressed all notes from @fabpot, I guess. Some portions of code are not shown as modified, but they are, actually.
I also added a small expectation in tests, I couldn't find any direct tests of AssetsInstallCommand. Failures in CI are unrelated
