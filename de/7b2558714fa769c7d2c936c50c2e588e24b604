Would using firstElementChild work instead of firstChild ?

`firstElementChild` will do the trick as this doesn't take text and comment nodes into account, but isn't supported on all browsers ([quirksmode](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_traversal.html)).

VarDumper is most likely used in a development environment so is the support for the older browsers still needed?
