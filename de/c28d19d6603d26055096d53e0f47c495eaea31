This is not enough. you are missing strings matching teh Yaml timestamp regex (which need to be rendered quoted as the unquoted version would be parsed as a timestamp) and strings requiring to be double quoted in YAML.
And on the other hand, you are sometimes quoting when unnecessary.

You should use the Yaml component to do the Yaml quoting instead of reimplementing it differently

@stof thanks for the suggestion, I've updated the patch

This will still not handle the timestamps, which are handled by the ``Inline`` dumper (which would also take care of many other cases which have been reimplemented in the reference dumper)

I've refactored the section to use the Inline class from the Yaml component.
