Why against 2.6 branch instead of 2.7?

Because this is where the deprecation has been introduced. The split could (and should) have been done at that time.

Rebased. Having worked a bit more on the subject, I reverted the split but prefixed the method testing deprecated interfaces with `testLegacy*`, and made it start by `$this->iniSet('error_reporting', -1 & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED);`
