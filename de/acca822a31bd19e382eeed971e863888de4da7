Sorry for the multiple commits, I have made it one by one from GitHub UI. I can squash them if it is a problem.

There are more of them:

I added `.gitattributes` files where they were missing, and also added `export-ignore` on test files.
By the way, I noticed that some the namespace of test files is sometimes `Test` on `Symfony\Contracts`, and that is not consistent with namespace `Tests` used everywhere else in Symfony codebase.

My bad, these should not be excluded.
