I'm wondering about merging this in 6.4 :thinking:

Rebased on 6.4

Thank you. I'm a bit reluctant to merge this as a bugfix because of the change in behavior though.

Then again, not having this change on 6.4 means we need to keep those bootstrap files for low-deps testing. Difficult decision. ğŸ™ˆ

yes they are, this line is deprecated indeed when $debug = false: `ini_set('assert.active', $debug);`
