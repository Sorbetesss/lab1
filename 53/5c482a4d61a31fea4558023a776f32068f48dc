I thought about it, but do we really need it, when the alternative is that one?
`$client->request(..., ['bearer' => $bearer]);`
vs
`$client->request(..., ['headers' => ['authorization: Bearer '.$bearer]]);`

Yes, it's shorter, but adding the option means added burden when implementing the interface.

Using a Bearer token is very common when requesting an API (more common than Basic). Also, it can be error prone (for instance, your example is wrong because the `B` of `Bearer` must be uppercased according to the RFC).

Regarding the burden, as this trait isn't internal, it should not be a big deal.
