Hello, thanks for your reply.

This actually is not a new feature, since the thread key in query parameters has no effect now on the new Google Chat API. Shouldn't this qualifies as a bug and the fix be backported to 5.4?

It introduces new code to handle the new threadKey . So this should go into 7.2 with the deprecation and the deprecation layer be removed in 8.0.

Someone who needs this should upgrade to 7.2 then

I agree that this should go in 7.2.

Thanks for your time reviewing this change.

I thought this was a good opportunity to update the options, but I guess this made too much noise around the actual fix.

Thanks for simplifying this PR. I think we can now consider it as a bugfix to guarantee compatibility with the Google API in the future and merge in 5.4 @symfony/mergers?

> Works for me as a bug fix for 5.4. @romain-jacquart Can you remove the CHANGELOG change and rebase on 5.4?

The branch has been rebased on 5.4 and CHANGELOG changes have been removed 👍.

The rebase has introduced a slight change regarding a variable's name (`$options` vs `$opts`). Will it be a problem?

Thanks!
