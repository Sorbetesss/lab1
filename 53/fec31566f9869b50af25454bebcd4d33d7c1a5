This requires tests, and support in the other mapping loaders

Thanks for the reminder, @jakzal. I still have this in mind; I remember that I could not find the mentioned mapping loaders or the appropriate tests for the "isser" as a template for the "hasser". I'll try to solve this during the winter holidays in the the next 2 weeks. I appreciate any suggestions :-)

You can find other loaders in the `src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Mapping/Loader` directory. All of the loaders should be able to handle "hassers".

Tests are located in `src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Tests/Mapping/Loader/*Test.php` files (each class should have a corresponding test class). The behaviour you should test belongs to `loadClassMetadata()` method.

I've implemented the "hasser" support for all loaders now (YAML, XML, Annotations), but I couldn't find a test for the existing "isser" support to use as a template and the line https://github.com/bicpi/symfony/blob/33efb029e7b7a5d186c3475b5c9ebe28a63e5a46/src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Mapping/GetterMetadata.php#L35 is not yet covered by a test. Maybe it makes sense to introduce two new methods to the `Entity` fixture for testing the "isser" and "hasser" support? Currently only the `getLastName` method is used to test the "getter" support.

@bicpi Can you indeed add the missing tests (by adding new methods on the Entity class)?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bicpi at 2013-12-29T20:43:42Z

Yes, I'll add the tests.

Any feedback on the added tests so I may improve this PR?

I'm sorry that I merged the upstream instead of rebasing. I can re-create a clean PR or something if it gets approved.

@bicpi You can rebase your code and push -f to remove the merge commit.

@fabpot Thanks a lot, now the commit history looks fine again.

Anything I can still do for this PR?
