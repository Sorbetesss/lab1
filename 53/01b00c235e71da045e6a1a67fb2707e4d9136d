What about `withMaxInputLength(PHP_INT_MAX)`? Isn't this risky practice?

I did that in my app (still on 6.3 ðŸ˜…) But If feels more natural to disable the feature completely if you don't want it.

@tgalopin there is no phpdoc at all in `HtmlSanitizerConfig` that would explain the reason to have a limit though.
