I have now thought about this, what about adding a `FormExtendedInterface` that extends both `FormInterface` and `ClearableErrorInterface`? The use case for the interface after all is to have a way to pass around form objects to functions and methods, and then you want an all inclusive interface that can cover all the methods implemented in the `Form` class. What do you think?

If the method is `clearErrors` than probably the interface might be `ClearableErrorsInterface`?

Good idea @vudaltsov, I like that better! I have made that change.

Tests are failing, but I don't think it's because of my changes.  All tests under `src/Symfony/Component/Form` are passing locally.
