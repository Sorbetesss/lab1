IMO you should update the dependency in the twig bridge to `~1.21` (https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/commit/56c73827750e6e0f5d94a290e8f00a9a8f48e459) since deprecation functionality was introduced there. Strictly it isn't required, since it shouldn't throw an error if the option is unknown at the moment, but it's more obvious this way.

@Tobion not necessary IMO (you would just not get the deprecation warning in this case, which is exactly what happens currently).

Yeah that's what I said. But again, what's the disadvantage and more explicit. That invalid options are ignored is an implementation detail to me.
