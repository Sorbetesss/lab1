@fabpot What about simplifying the phpunit config by avoiding to repeat the defaults ? The ``<phpunit>`` tag would then need only the ``bootstrap`` and ``colors`` parameters.

Otherwise, :+1: for adding the XSD

@stof I like being explicit, but as this file does not change that much over time, we can also remove the defaults. Can be done in another PR though.
