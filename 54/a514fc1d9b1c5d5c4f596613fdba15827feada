@nicolas-grekas In #28865 the default router generator and matcher were changed to the new `CompiledUrl` classes. This leads to an exception if the router is used along with a custom generator/matcher build with the previous classes. This is what was faced in the issue #31807

Rather than "force changing" the classes used by the router in case of mismatch, would it be better to revert the changes made on `Router::setOptions`, and add a deprecation warning(if needed)  if a legacy class is used?
