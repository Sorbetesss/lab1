3.4 does not have this bug, most likely due to #22441

at least tests fail :)

@nicolas-grekas Will work on tests if you agree we should fix it on 2.8.

We might also just wait for 2.8 to fade out if you don't have time to work on this :)

I was expecting this :-)

Personally, I‘ll probably have to deal with 2.8 for another year so I‘d be glad to have this fixed.

@nicolas-grekas Tests added – does it make sense to omit the `Exception` type hint to be PHP 5 and 7 compatible (no `\Throwable` on PHP 5 but possibly have to handle `\Error` on PHP7)?
