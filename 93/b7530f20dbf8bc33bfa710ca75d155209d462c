@dunglas (sorry) in my and you test:

    <document index="182077241760011681341821060401202210011000045913000000017100">Name</document>

`index` attribute is not a number, but very similar.

After converting to a float, you lost data...

Sorry @valisj I'm not sure to understand what you mean here

```
var_dump(is_numeric('182077241760011681341821060401202210011000045913000000017100'));
bool(true)
```

Indeed, but as with the `JsonEncoder` (and as usually with programming languages). But as you pointed out in the issue, it's problematic that things looking like numbers are automatically converted. It should be an opt-in feature (through a context flag). It's a BC break but it's safer and will avoid unexpected behaviors like this one. ping @symfony/deciders
