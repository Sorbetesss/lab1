Could you please add a test case?

@nicolas-grekas I've added a test for this.

Hmm, strange, its failing on the tests. But passes locally. I'll take a look at that this evening.

I'm a little confused, it is failing on php 5.5, but is fine on php 7.0+. Nothing I changed should affect 5.5, any ideas?

@alexbowers PHP changed how `substr()` behaved when the start parameter is the same as the length of the string (see also https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php and https://3v4l.org/tfZgp).

Hmm, can AppVeyor be re-ran?

I can't see any cause for it failing.
