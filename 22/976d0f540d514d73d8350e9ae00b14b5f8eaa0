Did you mix things up? Group â€žaâ€œ is only existent in the code change but not in the example in the PR header ðŸ¤”
Did you mean â€žlistâ€œ ?

`MetadataAwareNameConverter` was introduced in 4.2 @nicolas-grekas (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/28505)

The patch doesn't change anything related to that, but changes `AbstractObjectNormalizer`.
It also applies to 3.4, so it would make sense to apply it to 3.4 then. That's my reasoning at least.
Why changing the behavior as a bug fix otherwise?

I've updated the patch @nicolas-grekas as I think that the real underlying issue was in the `MetadataAwareNameConverter` caching system.
I understood that the static properties were introduced to improve performance but they are also causing this issue.
