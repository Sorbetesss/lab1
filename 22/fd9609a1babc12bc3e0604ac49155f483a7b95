I would add a test if I could even begin to know how to write a test for it. It's too deep into a private method and do not really know how to set it up

Maybe you can take inspiration from the tests added to #41463?

In #41463 there was no test added for the `Serializer` component after the fixes. The test was added for `Validator`, related to the changes made in `Symfony\Component\Validator\Mapping\Loader\PropertyInfoLoader`
