@fabpot Can you look into this? Is there no dedicated merger/decider for Security?

@schmittjoh, @fabpot Any chance either of you could tell us what to do to get this handled or (preferably :wink: )merged in? Or is our expectation of the `entry_point` behaviour wrong?
This is slowly becoming a major blocker for us...

Thanks in advance!

This looks like a valid fix. Without it, a custom entry point will indeed never be injected into the security listener.

However, it would be good to include tests for this. It's probably the best to add some functional tests (see [Tests/Functaional in the SecurityBundle](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/Tests/Functional)).

Cheers, we'll look into adding the tests.

@jakzal As promised, I added a functional test. The test fails as expected at eeaf21b.

@jakzal Failing test is unrelated. Can this be merged?

@rjkip I'll review this weekend.

@jakzal Did you manage to take a look at this? Thanks in advance!

@stof, @webmozart, @Tobion, @romainneutron, @nicolas-grekas, @fabpot As far as I can see in http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/core_team.html#active-core-members there is no "merger" assigned for the SecurityBundle, any chance either of you can take a peek at this?

Edit: spelling
