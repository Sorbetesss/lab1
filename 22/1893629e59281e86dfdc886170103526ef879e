Big :+1: for this. Thanks @mvrhov!

BTW: I have no idea why the php 5.3.x seg'faults when running tests on Travis.

@fabpot: Any chances of having this in 2.2? I really need this in my next project and I would be a shame if I had to maintain a 2.2 fork just because of this feature

Looks good apart from a few minor issues!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mvrhov at 2013-04-18T07:52:03Z

This has been implemented as a part of #7386

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bschussek at 2013-04-18T07:59:31Z

@mvrhov FYI #7386 does not contain a Currency type or validator.

Ok, I'll reopen and rebase this later today.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mvrhov at 2013-04-22T10:02:20Z

This is now rebased

Thank you @mvrhov! :) :+1:

Please let me know before merging so I can cherry pick this on master and do a clean PR.
I'm afraid that even though I squashed the commits this PR will weigh a hefty 2,8M, due to currency resources data that are not needed anymore.

Looks good :) Not sure what you mean with your last comment, but do whatever you feel is necessary!

@mvrhov As you squashed your commits, I think there are no problems with the old data.
