as this is considered a bugfix, should we merge it into lower branches ? Projects might use the first-class callable syntax with Symfony 5.4 too

Indeed. Now targeting 4.4

@nicolas-grekas I think you also need to fix the `TraceableEventDispatcher` class as it also contains a few `=== $listener`

This behavior is new to PHP 8.1: https://3v4l.org/Zr0m7
See https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/6a9daafed4d26cd26b730e07e9339e35fb833f58
Updated to skip the tests on PHP < 8.1
