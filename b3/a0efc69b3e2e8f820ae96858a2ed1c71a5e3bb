Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.2 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Should this be merged into the `4.4` branch?

Do what you think is right.

Will the error output look differently after this change? If so, can you share before and after screenshots?

@aleksandr-shevchenko can you please submit the PR for 4.4? The code is not exactly the same.
Please mind the commit message/PR title also since this is going to be used for the changelog.
Thanks.

@nicolas-grekas the difference in 4.4 is from PR #47883 ... so i guess it shoud be rebased to 4.4 and then merged to 4.4?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2022-10-19T11:55:59Z

yes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is anyone willing to submit this change to 4.4?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by maxbeckers at 2022-10-26T05:27:53Z

I'd do that, but I guess I only could create a new PR with the change. So @aleksandr-shevchenko should do the rebase.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did the rebase and switched the target branch to `4.4`.
