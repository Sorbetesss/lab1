i don't like it to make `security.authorization_checker` private.
i have many bundles in my projects (like Sonata, or Sensio) which does use this service for the `isGranted` check. what else should be used for that?

@Hanmac this is making
`Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\AuthorizationCheckerInterface`
and
`Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\UserPasswordEncoderInterface`
private,
it doesn't change anything when using `security.authorization_checker`.

I'm üëç for this, as we never documented these aliases (they are there for autowiring purpose only)
