I already said that throwing the exception is the easy way, and I don't agree with that as it really doesn't solve the actual problem. If this cannot be solved otherwise I'd rather have getParameter returning null. And documentation explicitly stating that when parameters contain expression the getParameter function returns null for that specific parameter

@mvrhov why do you want to use expressions in parameters? If you want to do that, you should create the parameter in the Extension of the bundle

I said that in original ticket in my case that's for multitenat application Where some parameters are dependant on the tenant.

@mvrhov As parameters are resolved at compilation time and dumped statically, it won't work. You should use the expression in the argument instead of using it in a parameter.

I can't configure 3rd party bundles like this? Also the services that are configured via parameters.yml seem to work just fine, the only problem ATM is the parameters array. That's why my suggestion is to write null for those keys.

I've updated the original issue with additional information.
