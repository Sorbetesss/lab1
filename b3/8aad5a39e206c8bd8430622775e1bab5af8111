> Did you actually encounter the issue?

yes, on Apache. Command line and Unit tests work.
> If yes, what's your variables_order setting like?

variables_order => GPCS => GPCS
> Do you know why `$_SERVER` doesn't contain the env vars on your setup?

Yes, on the Apache vHost I would need to set the missing  env vars with `PassEnv Foo` to use them.
