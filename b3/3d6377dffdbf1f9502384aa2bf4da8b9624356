Doesn't this have to be merged into the 2.3 branch since the SensioDistributionBundle can be used with older Symfony versions too?

@xabbuh I took care not to cause BC break by adding a param to find() function

@JJK801 But the ``findArguments()`` method of the ``PhpExecutableFinder`` class wouldn't be available if you didn't require the Process component in a higher version than 2.2.

this should be covered by a test IMO

@fabpot is it ok to merge it ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@JJK801 :+1: This looks good to me know. However, can you rebase your PR on current master to remove the merge commit? Thanks.

This should be merged in 2.3 to be able to resolve sensiolabs/SensioDistributionBundle#150.

I guess under normal circumstances we wouldnt merge something like this into 2.3. but I guess it can be seen as a bug fix, rather than a new feature. also alternative language implementation compatibility issue are sort of a new category of issue to deal with.
