In the issue, @javiereguiluz says "The real solution is that you must set the `framework.csrf_protection` config option to `true` or `null`". This PR changed it to "install `symfony/security-csrf`". Can we confirm that installing will always fix it, or do we need to add the config option to the message?

The option is enabled by default as soon as the `symfony/security-csrf` package is enabled. So I am not sure if it's worth adding the option too.

I agree with Christian ... installing the missing package is probably enough to solve this issue (I can't test it myself now). Thanks!
