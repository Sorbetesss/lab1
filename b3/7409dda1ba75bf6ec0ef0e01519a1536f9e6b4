I finished this PR now. I did not improve the test coverage of ModelChoiceList since currently none of our Propel tests uses a temporary database, which is needed here, but I don't know how to set it up. I propose to merge this PR as is and improve the ModelChoiceList test suite later on in cooperation with the propel guys. /cc @willdurand

If this is a but fix with no BC beaks, this PR should be merged into 2.2, right?

I'll check whether this is possible

Ok, here are three versions now:

* #8980 is based on 2.2
* #8981 contains the same commits as #8980, but based on 2.3 and with merged conflicts (hence the commits differ)
* this PR contains the same commits as #8981, plus one more which deprecates a few methods, and is based on master
