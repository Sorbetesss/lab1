The protected, I can understand. But why the abstract?

@iltar I agree @hhamon on this point: if all methods are now protected/private, the class shouldn't be intantiable. As an abstract class can't be instantiated, we improve the behavior of the use of this (helper/sugar) class.

Curiously, Travis now complain and want to remove symfony 3.x release ... /c @fabpot

```

I tend to not use abstract on a class if it doesn't provide abstract methods nor missing methods from an interface, it looks weird to me. But I guess there's something to say for that as you shouldn't initiate this class yourself. If for any reason the abstract should be removed in a future patch, it will stay backwards compatible so it won't be a problem either way. :+1:

@iltar the ``abstract`` keyword embrace 2 differents concepts:
* an ``abstract`` class means you can't instanciate it, but only classes that extends it.
* ``abstract`` method is more than a contract - like interface - enforce you to make your own implementation of this methods in children classes

The point is you don't need to have ``abstract`` methods to be allowed to use ``abstract`` keyword on a class as the ``abstract`` keyword has not the same sense.
