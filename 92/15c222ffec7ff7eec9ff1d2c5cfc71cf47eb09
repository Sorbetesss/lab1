anyone on why travis is failing in that way "Pull request or branch commit hash has changed, aborting!" ?

@cordoval Since #14047 Travis builds are stopped for a PR when there are more recent commits pushed to it. Actually, only the build status of the last pushed commit is of interest.

Just curious: Did you push another commit which you removed again later?
