Two more ideas:
- add before/after for bin/console in UPGRADE files
- bump symfony/console to 4.2 (in require-dev and conflict) so that we're sure to get console 4.2 when fwb 4.2 is installed (will make the recipe much simpler)

I'm merging quickly so that the recipes work with 4.2 (they're broken for now.)
It will allow us to play with the new experience more easily to ensure 4.2 will be smooth.
If you have more comments here, please do post them and I'll ensure they're resolved asap.
