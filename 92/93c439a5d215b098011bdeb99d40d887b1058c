I'd rather say, as also stated in the ticket, that `cannotBeEmpty` on a boolean node (etc.) makes no sense. So it should rather throw an exception.

So I'm +-0 with this solution.

I thought about that too, but decided to go this way as throwing an exception would potentially break many existing applications.

Then just change it in 2.8 or 3.0

Then I suggest to mark the method as deprecated in 2.8 and throw the exception in 3.0. Do you agree with this plan?

@xabbuh I agree

see #15285 for the deprecations

I just discovered that the changes did not cover float nodes properly. I moved the check from `IntegerNode` to `NumericNode`.
