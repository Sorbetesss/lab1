The PHP 8.2 test failure seems unrelated...

The Appveyor test seems to target Windows (?) and this is suspicious:

```
Symfony\Component\VarDumper\Tests\Server\ConnectionTest::testDump
Symfony\Component\Process\Exception\ProcessTimedOutException: The process "c:\php\php.exe" exceeded the timeout of 9 seconds.
```

I'll postpone digging too deeply into that until I get feedback on the general approach, though. If this is something Symfony will concern itself with, then we can address that.

Hey!

I think @abdounikarim has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

It looks like we should consider this as a bug, so this should probably be rebased on 4.4?

Thanks for the review, @fabpot.

I wasn't sure if this was a purposeful omission or not (I erred on the side of yes, it was) so I can recategorize and retarget as a bug.
