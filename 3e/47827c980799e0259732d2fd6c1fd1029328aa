I based this on `master`, let me know if it should be based on something else.

You should rebase it, so that it can be merged into 4.1 ‚Äì as bugfix. üëç

@apfelbox rebase done, thank you. Should this PR target `4.1` instead of `master`, too ?

rebased on 4.1, PR target changed to 4.1 and description updated

Not sure why appveyor build fails, this seems unrelated (it's in the SecurityBundle, which this PR doesn't change) :

Is this legit at the semantic level? Could this be a BC break? Can't we get rid of the whitespace by removing the blank characters between tags?

@nicolas-grekas see my comments in #28116 that should explain why this is a bugfix (I sent the same changes in a PR just minutes after this one).
