Looks like we first need to fix the dumper on lower versions.

@xabbuh The other PRs have been merged now. Can you merge 2.8 into master and rebase this one?

@fabpot Unfortunately, my fix in #17814 broke our test suite when being executed with newer versions of the Yaml component. I think we should fix the test suite for all branches first (see #17816 for the start).

Tests finally pass. This is ready to be reviewed.
