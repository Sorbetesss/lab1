When merging this PR in 3.2, we should add checks for each `if` with the new `ClassExistenceResource` resource.

And regarding the extensions, we already have checks in a compiler pass. So I would rather fix them here if they are missing some condition rather than  doing a second system in the DI extension itself.

I also moved most of the clean up logic into the compiler passes except for the `twig.translation.extractor` service which didn't fit well in any of the existing passes.

This one should be good to merge now.
