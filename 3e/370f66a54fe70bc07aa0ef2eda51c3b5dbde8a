This implementation has a big drawback compared to the Twig extension: you must remove all stopwatch calls before going into prod, otherwise you get a fatal error when rendering your template calling stopwatch (or you need to check all the time in your template whether ``$view['stopwatch']->getStopwatch()`` is ``null`` or not). On the other hand, the Twig extension handles this case gracefully when compiling the template.

IMO, the templating helper should provide proxy methods for the Stopwatch features (being no-ops if there is no Stopwatch in the helper) instead of exposing the Stopwatch itself.

@stof I've fixed it by using a proxy class, like you suggested.

After writing the docs I decided to do it different without a proxy class.
