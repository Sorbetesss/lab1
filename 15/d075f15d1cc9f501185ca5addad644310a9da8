Failing tests seems unrelated.

Thanks for submitting this ❤️

I think it should target 6.2 however, as a new feature rather than a bug fix

Well i guess its debatable if its a bug or feature. Since the Attribute supports to be set on properties and 5.4 is supporting php 8.0 you could say it's a bug. But I'm fine with saying this is a new feature 😅
