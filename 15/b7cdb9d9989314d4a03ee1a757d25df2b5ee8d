@fabpot when bumping the version to 4.0, you forgot to update all inter-component requirements to allow them to use the 4.0 version of other components in their own 4.0 versions

Looks like this requires us to drop HHVM, impossible to make it run on the CI. I'm fine with that personally.

In addition to the poll, [according to the latest global PHP stats](https://seld.be/notes/php-versions-stats-2017-1-edition), HHVM is used by 0.36% of PHP developers. The number is practically zero ... but maybe there are some high-profile clients there (Facebook is using it, Slack was thinking about using it, ...)

@javiereguiluz please don't forget that the stats are about number of composer installs.. That doesn't translate 1:1 to users, as some may do more installs than others. I think it's mostly interesting to see trends over time as exact point-in-time numbers can't be fully trusted.

@nicolas-grekas HHVM has 2 modes: PHP 5 mode and PHP 7 mode. IIRC, it runs in PHP 5 mode by default. We should add `hhvm.php7.all = 1` in the HHVM INI file.

I just tried again this mode, same failure. We'd need a php *7.1* mode. There is just no way currently to make hhvm run on a 7.1 code base. HHVM advertises itself as 70099 so even Composer cant.
Just dropping for now.

Have you tried using the latest HHVM rather than 3.18 ? they may have updated their PHP 7 mode to expose it as 7.1 later

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2017-05-18T07:47:46Z

Yep, 3.19 locally, same result

Now with all lowest deps updated to `~3.4`, same process we did for 3.0

👍 even if I would be to use `>=7.1.3` instead of `^7.1.3` because:

* It will prevent people to upgrade to PHP 8 because of old Symfony apps
* PHP is almost always backward compatible
* PHP doesn't respect strictly semver
* Laravel and most other projects use this notation
