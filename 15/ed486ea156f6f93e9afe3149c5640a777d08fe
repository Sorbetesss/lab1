(fabbot failure is false positive)

That means `FooCircular` will get in its constructor a `BarCircular` instance not fully configured yet (without `foobar`), right? Isn't it an issue?

@ogizanagi how that? I don't think that's the case.

Just trying to dump `$bar` in `FooCircular`'s constructor:

```php
BarCircular {
  +foobar: null
}
```

but that's actually the only way to solve the circular dependency AFAIU. Or did I miss something?

@ogizanagi I'm sorry but I'm not able to reproduce your dump. I added type hints on the classes to ensure that `null` is not a possible value of the `foobar` property, and everything still works.
