I've just made all the suggested changes. To avoid having the static method call, I've made the `$message` constructor be the safe message. I think this is still safe because I've renamed the class to highlight that you're passing in a safe message. We could *not* override the constructor and force the setter to be called to - it's just a little less convenient.

@WouterJ check it out now - I just simplified things - I think this makes more sense.
