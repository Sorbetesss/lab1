If we only want start/end/interval to be nicely dumped, that would already work as is right?

Im not sure about the fancy period formatting :) though i like your creativity :+1:

agree with @ro0NL, not really convinced myself sorry...
maybe something like "every $period from $start to $end" (& variants)?

Ok, I made tests green and I updated format. Example with end date (1) and with recurrences (2):

```
1) every + 1d, from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 (included) to 2017-01-03 00:00:00
2) every + 1d, from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 (included) for 2x
```

I kept tooltip with the dates included in the period. I find this useful, and you?
