Hey!

Oh no, it looks like you have made this PR towards a branch that is not maintained anymore. :/
Could you update the [PR base branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request) to target one of these branches instead? 4.4, 5.4, 6.0, 6.1.

Cheers!

Should target 6.1 instead (as this is not a bug).

Changed, I wasn't sure because it's not a feature either :)

The rule is that old branches can only get bug fixes, nothing else.

Thank you @codedmonkey.
