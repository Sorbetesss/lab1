I would rather fail with a good error message explaining you your mistake rather than silently ignoring the invalid pattern.

@stof Right, I force-pushed a check that will throw an error instead of ignoring it.

If it's ok for you, tests will have to be updated to handle this case in a new test.

I think this should be rebased on 6.2.
Can you update the tests?

What if using an empty item in another part of the config throw another error in another part of Symfony? Should the config validator be more strict? As I wrote in #46833, the YAML (or XML, etc.) is still valid.

the Yaml being valid for the Yaml parser does not mean that the content of this Yaml is a valid input for the DependencyInjection file loader. That's why it is the FileLoader doing its validation on the input it expects.

Tests fail, see failures + fabbot report also.

It'd be better to create dedicated test cases to me. Can you please update the PR to do so?

The branch has been rebased and tests have been added.
