Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.4".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Ah: why do you consider this as a bugfix? To me it's for 7.2

To me it's a bug and not a feature? It's not working without the service defined.
