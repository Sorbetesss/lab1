It's only an issue if the default context for the cache key is changed by a child class and if the constructor is called afterwards, doesn't it?

A test case would be nice if you can.

@alanpoulain it's even the case if you just pass the keys to exclude as parameter of the constructor.
@nicolas-grekas test added and exception message fixed

Is this one still relevant? I see that the original issue has been closed as the problem has been fixed in PHP itself IIUC? /cc @dunglas @nicolas-grekas

AFAIK it's still an issue.

@dunglas  Ok, can you rebase so that we can merge?
