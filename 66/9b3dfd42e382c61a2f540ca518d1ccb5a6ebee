This PR was not getting much attention.

Since the scope was a little too large, I've removed some non-essential features (card DSL, create transform from webhookUrl) in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/36488/commits/1b1946c30a2cc24fa64a486d0614b7793bdcf7e9. I hope It can be accepted with this scope.
