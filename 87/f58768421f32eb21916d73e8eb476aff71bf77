As this is a new feature, it should target the master branch (which is 4.1). 3.4 is closed for new features and you're currently targeting 3.3, which will only receive bug fixes.

@PabloKowalczyk you'll have to change your branch to be based on the master, both locally and in in this PR, no need to create a new PR.

@ro0NL Could you give me more details, please? What methods should i test?

@ro0NL what exactly are you willing to test? I'm not convinced yet of the value of more tests for these changes :)

in general, you would test the usecase from a compiled/dumped container; asserting a real constructed service instead of a definition. But i agree the current test implies it should work :+1:
