Tests and psalm fail, can you please have a look?

Psalm is a false positive. I'll look into the low-deps tests.

The low-deps test failed because we need doctrine/annotations#412. I've bumped `doctrine/annotations` to `^1.13.1` to address this.

low-deps is passing now. The new PHPUnit failure is unrelated (Database connection issues).
