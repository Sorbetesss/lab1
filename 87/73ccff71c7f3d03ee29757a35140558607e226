Can you provide a reproducer for the issue? Maybe a test case?
There is already such a check when $value is a Definition.
Which triggers this: what's the type/class of $value in your case and more importantly how does it get there?

Yes i can. Let me anticipate you that error happens when `$value` is not a `Definition` but instance of `Symfony\Component\ExpressionLanguage\Expression`

@nicolas-grekas I have just integrated a test case
