@stof Still WIP but I've made some changes to make deprecated aliases a thing as pointed out in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/38389#issuecomment-702843630. WDYT ?

@jderusse I adressed all your comments except the ones where I left a comment indicating otherwise.

@jderusse @derrabus I have rebased the PR on top of `5.4` branch and adressed all your comments.

I tested this on a local test project and it worked as I would expect.

Do you have any more reviews to make ?

AppVeyor's failure is unrelated.

@nicolas-grekas @stof I believe I adressed all your comments.
