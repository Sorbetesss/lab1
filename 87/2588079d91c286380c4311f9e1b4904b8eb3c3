i wonder if @fabbot is good with `js` syntax stuff too

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed some styling (still not 100% sure if it's right) and made the sections collapsable (need styling)

@WouterJ Do you expect to finish this one soon? Or do you need some help?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2013-12-28T12:15:38Z

@fabbot I've now done 2 of the 3 points. I can take a look at the third point tomorrow I think. Then the only thing that needs to be done is remember which sections/forms were collapsed and which not. At the moment, I don't have an idea how to do that, but I think we can merge this PR without that feature.

Thank you for working on this @WouterJ! :) Let us know when you're finished so we can test the PR

@bschussek @fabbot I've finished this PR now. I did not include the session storage for the expanded elements, I don't know how to implement that in a good way. I'll leave that to another person.

For the reference, a screenshot:

The screenshot looks awesome! Going to test the implementation now :)

As a side note, this is going to be merged into master, not 2.4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2013-12-29T18:12:13Z

@fabpot agreed, don't know why I submitted it for 2.4...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bschussek at 2013-12-30T14:35:19Z

I really like it! :) I made some small changes in WouterJ/symfony#1. With those changes applied, the PR can be merged. Thanks!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2013-12-30T17:07:25Z

Merged @bschussek's PR. And with that PR, I now know how to integrate session storage. So I've put it in WIP mode again, will work on that tomorrow.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bschussek at 2013-12-30T18:20:28Z

@WouterJ I suggest to merge this PR now and add session storage in a separate PR. That will make the review of the session storage changes easier. :)

ping @fabpot

Oh, I just realized that blue_picto_full.gif is still in. Could you please remove it from this PR? It's unused by now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2013-12-30T19:16:01Z

@bschussek ok, I'll do that

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterJ at 2013-12-30T20:22:56Z

btw, @bschussek when you want to review the storage: WouterJ/symfony@18cf601f20f5e690f9e71ef6d3b6d92069068700 :P
