In https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/28462#issuecomment-480529128, @curry684 suggest to always use `error`. @linaori WDYT?

IIUC, it should always be an `error`. If that's the case, @berezuev Can you make the change? And rebase on 4.4 where this would be merged?

@fabpot I've done this change and set PR's destination to 4.4 branch.
Not sure about tests. It fails w/o any warnings or errors.
