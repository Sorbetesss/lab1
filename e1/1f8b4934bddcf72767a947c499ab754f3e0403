Any other opinions on this?

Do we really need to keep the old `renderTable()` method? It's only used by the `TextDescriptor` and it's unlikely anyone derived from the `Descriptor` and relies on `renderTable()`.

@jakzal To me it seems unlikely that someone relies on the existing method, but strictly speaking changing its signature would be a BC break. That's why I introduced the new method.

It would indeed be a BC break, but an allowed one. These classes are not part of the API. Given it's unlikely that anyone would rely on them, I don't think it would be a big deal to remove the old method. It is confusing to have `renderTable()` and `renderConsoleTable()`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We should at least deprecate the old method.

Indeed, `protected` non-API methods are not guaranteed to be backward compatible. I removed `renderConsoleTable()`, changed the signature of `renderTable()` and added instructions to the upgrade file.

It's fine to break BC here in 2.7, but do we really want to do that in 2.5? I think that nobody should have relied on this part of the code, but I just want to raise the concern once more before merging.

@fabpot Do you want me to revert the last change and introduce the `renderConsoleTable()` method again? Or should we wait on the opinion of the other deciders?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2014-12-30T10:46:16Z

I think that merging it as is is the way to go.

You have to fix tests (the lowest version of dependencies seems to be not ok).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@saro0h Thanks for the hint. I updated the dependencies to make the tests pass again.
