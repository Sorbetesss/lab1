Well the fix is uglier than I thought :thinking:

As of Doctrine 2.9 the method to configure the assets filter has changed : https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/commit/111e42dfb43d1ea0853a449c254df20df2cced37

doctrine-dbal 2.9 introduce the new methods `getSchemaAssetsFilter` / `setSchemaAssetsFilter`. Before it was `getFilterSchemaAssetsExpression` / `getFilterSchemaAssetsExpression`

So I need to try if the method exists before

Quick work - thanks! Yea, that got ugly :). I can't think of another way either - can anyone else? If not, I think we need this - without it, it's an even uglier situation for the user.
