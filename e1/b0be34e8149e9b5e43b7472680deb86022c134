The current behavior might be somewhat unexpected. But if we just change it, we will break existing applications. Can we make it so that both ways work?

Method names are case insentitive in PHP, right? So, is there a bug that needs to fix here or is it just for a better looking method name?

If we don't configure a method name, `RegisterListenersPass` will guess it. And that logic is case-sensitive.

It's about allowing a less surprising method name, I'd say.
