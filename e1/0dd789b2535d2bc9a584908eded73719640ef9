Can you also provide the few missing translations in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Resources/translations/validators.eu.xlf (English goes to id 93 while Basque only has them until id 85) ?

> I will assume that the translations themselves are good. I don't think we have anyone in the core team speaking Basque to review them (I may be wrong though)

Maybe @javiereguiluz? He's from Vitoria.

I'm going to see what can I do...

Yes, I understand some Basque. Translation looks correct to me, but we could ping our friend @ikerib who speaks Basque perfectly and contributed some translations in the past! Thanks.

This was done before
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/30223/commits/f496ab638e0f9161812938e942f5fb22012b20a3

Do I need to do it again?

@ikerib in f496ab6 you contributed the translations related to "validators" ... but in Symfony we have other translation files. In this PR, @cluster28 is translating the "security" file. So, we wonder if you have some time to double check these new translations and propose some fixes if needed. Thanks!

Ahhhh I see. Ok, I’m on holidays now but I’ll do it as soon as possible ;-)

Why does this PR update `security.eu.xlf` and `validators.es.xlf` but not `validators.eu.xlf`?

@nicolas-grekas the title of the PR is misleading. We're updating two different languages in the same PR.

Should we merge as is for now?
