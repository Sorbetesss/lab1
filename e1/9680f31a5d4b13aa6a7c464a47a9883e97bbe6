@Tobion What about this PR? Do you have time to finish it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Tobion at 2014-01-01T15:26:15Z

@fabpot yes I will. Do you agree with all the points in the description?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Tobion at 2014-10-08T21:25:55Z

@fabpot this is ready. IMO this should be merged into 2.3 to reduce the divergence. But lets see what the mergers say.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks good to me. I'm a bit reluctant to merge it into 2.3 though. What @symfony/deciders think?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, fixing the inconsistencies in the type of values could go in 2.3 IMO. but turning the API into a fluent one should only be done in master IMO. It is not a bugfix

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@stof agreed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree as well

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would consider the fluent thing a bug fix because one method had this already (probably unintentional). So either the ugly code stays in an LTS version or we make all setters fluent (which is not considered a bc break).

If you still want me to split it, I can do it though

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2014-10-09T15:15:40Z

I prefer to stay strict on what we do in 2.3. So, the split looks like a better option to me (even if indeed these changes are not a big deal.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you go, the one for 2.3: #12190

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Tobion at 2014-10-09T15:36:57Z

If #12190 is merged and 2.3 merged into master, I can rebase this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2014-10-09T16:00:35Z

#12190 merged and 2.3 merged into master

Adjusted
