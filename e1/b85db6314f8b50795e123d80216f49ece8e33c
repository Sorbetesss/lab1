Then you could add dozens of more helper methods. It's just the one that is used most often.

I agree with @Tobion , we could not add a helper for each HTTP status code.

But is one could avoid big mistake: Lot of people throw an `Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\AccessDeniedHttpException` and so by-pass the security layer.

We have a rule for this in [SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/) and this violations is quite often triggered.

Precisely the reason for this PR, @lyrixx. Many people using IDE's usually import the wrong exception. A helper method guarantees the usage of the proper one.

This helper function could be usefull if there is an option to redirect to the configured `form_login` in the firewalls. Now I make use of the following code snippet to redirect to the login form, and return to the current page thereafter:

        if (!$this->get('security.context')->isGranted('ROLE_ADMIN')) {

			// Put the URL in the session
			$this->container->get('session')->set('_security.main.target_path', $this->generateUrl('product_show',
				array('id' => $document->getId()),
				UrlGeneratorInterface::ABSOLUTE_URL
			));

			// Redirect to the login form
			return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('login'));
		}

Maybe returning the redirect could be generic? Like returning/redirecting to the current active firewall login method?

@klaussilveira Can you submit a PR on the symfony docs to add documentation for this new feature?

Also, can you rebase on current master as some tests were broken at the time you forked master. Thanks.

Sorry for the delay, rebased and fixed guys.
