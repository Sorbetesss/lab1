I just copied and pasted code from elsewhere in the toolbar, sorry.

I never noticed this problem, but I can confirm it's not meant to be like this and needs fixing, thanks for correcting my bad code.

Since adding this feature though, it's literally been the thing I click most in the toolbar - its a real timesaver.

Phil, thanks for confirming this. So, then this is OK for review and merge. Thanks.
