3.4 is affected by this too, isn't it?

Yes, the fix probably need to be applied there too.

@umpirsky Can you rebase on the `3.4` branch? :)

It will be easier to create a new PR. :)

@umpirsky if you'd like to, I can have a look at this PR and rebase it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will look into it soon...

I reset to 3.4 and cherry-picked changes. Thanks for the patience!
