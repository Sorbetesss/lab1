Should be done on master as this is a behavior change.

Thinking about it, I think changing the default value depending on the YAML component availability is not a good idea. I would instead keep the default and throw an exception when YAML is used (either explicitly or implicitly) and the component is not installed.

Fair enough. But if we don't change the default, all this PR does is replacing an ugly exception with a nice error message. And that would be a valid thing to do in a bugfix release, wouldn't it?
