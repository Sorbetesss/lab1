Just to make sure, if a user removes an input field from a form manuelly (like firebug), which means the field is not submitted anymore, the field on the model will still be validated, or? Otherwise it would be a security problem.

@Tobion what is not validated anymore are constraints attached on the field itself (and only for PATCH)

@Tobion Good point. But that means that even for a PATCH request, one would have to specify which fields are submitted, leading the current implementation of PATCH requests (with the `$clearMissing` flag) ad absurdum...
