Thanks for the PR. This looks like a new feature to me. As such, that's for 5.4.
Looking at other handlers, they would too benefit from options.
Also, `MemcachedSessionHandler` uses `expiretime` instead of `ttl` and defaults to 86400 instead of `ini_get('session.gc_maxlifetime')` :facepalm:
Can you please have a look and try to add some consistency there?
Don't forget to update the CHANGELOG of the component while doing so.
Thanks!

@nicolas-grekas thank you for the feedback. I updated the PR to let other handlers benefit from options.
