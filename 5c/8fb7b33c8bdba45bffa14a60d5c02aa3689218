Thanks, please rebase and retarget for branch 4.4, as we don't add deprecations on other branches.

@nicolas-grekas  Done
Even if I'm not sure of what I have done :/

@dFayet It looks like your merged a branch here. It makes the pull request not-mergeable on our side. Can you rebase your branch (it will remove the merge commit)?

Can you have a look at the tests, they seem to be broken because of these changes (low).

@fabpot Done for low. Is there anything to be done for the high one?
