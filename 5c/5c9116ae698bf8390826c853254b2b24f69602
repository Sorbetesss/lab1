Not sure about this one. AFAIU, the user will now receive two deprecation notices as if they don't pass Twig env as a constructor argument, they probably call the setter.

well, if they pass it in the constructor and still call the setter later, removing the setter would break their app without warning. So we need a deprecation warning there (to avoid the double deprecation warning, we may trigger it only when we already have an environment)

Indeed, updated to avoid the double warning. Should this target 3.2? If so I'll update the corresponding UPGRADE file

3.3 is fine.
