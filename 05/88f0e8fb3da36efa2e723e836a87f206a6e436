So, I found a BC way to fix the issue and enhance the `ErrorHandler::register` function.
Tests missing, but review could already happen on the submitted patch.

This is ready for review/merge.
The new signature of the `ErrorHandler::register()` method allows injecting the handler to register,
and enabling/disabling the replacement of any previous error handler.
This is used by the FrameworkBundle: no error handler is registered if one is already in place (fixes #12327).
The previous interface (levels to register/throw) is still available (BC) by using polymorphism.
Thus, calling `ErrorHandler::register($levels)` is deprecated in favour of `ErrorHandler::register()->throwAt($levels, true)`.

@nicolas-grekas Your header says "no" deprecations which seems not true.

And said "yes" to BC break, which is also not true. Swap done thanks for noticing.
