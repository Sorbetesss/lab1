I have often some issues in vendor so for me it will be more complicated to get to the point.
If you really want to go this way, could you add a "remember my last choice" cookie ?
Like we do with the debug bar (expanded / collapsed)

Thanks

Would be great if the toggle could be inplace of the hidden vendors. Putting it on the top right corner makes it hard to spot.
We need a visual hint (some ellipses) that there is something hidden.

Or instead of hidding the full vendor frame, can't we just hide the arguments?
I'd be extra cautious with hidding debugging info, because debugging generally needs full context to understand an issue.

After reading your comments, I propose a complete redesign of this feature. Now we don't hide anything, we just make info more compact for vendors and keep the existing design for your code.
