Deprecation can be done in 3.4, let me know if you want a PR.

I suggest deprecating EnvParametersResource in 3.4, in favor of env placeholders. The implementation of this resource is tied to the old logic reading magic env variables. It is not a generic resource for env variable usage anyway, so using it in other contexts that HttpKernel would be weird.

Basically it's a resource to verify freshness of any env var, tied to a prefix. i think it fits config component, it's generic enough for that imo, but im not sure it be useful to anyone =/
