PR is ready, failure unrelated (composer bug).
New feature inside: one has now the ability to remap source links by prefix so that container/vm can create links that refer to the host.

E.g. `subl://%f:%l#/foo/=/home/foo/&/bar=/home/bar/` while replace `/foo/...` & `/bar/...` paths by the mapped prefix.
