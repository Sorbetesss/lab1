I'm not sure about this because it introduces a different behavior in the toolbar depending on the panel the user clicks.

Well.. currently it's the only block (by default) that has no click handler (ie. is not a link). So it already behaves different, but in a more frustrating way :)

it's truly convenient :))

i think we should do this for all blocks that are not linking btw =/ (ie. `.sf-toolbar-block > .sf-toolbar-icon` vs. `.sf-toolbar-block > a > .sf-toolbar-icon`) if that's the standard format.
