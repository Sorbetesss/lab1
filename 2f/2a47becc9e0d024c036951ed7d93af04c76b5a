If we decide to add this format, to merge in 4.1 as a new feature.

@nicolas-grekas Do you agree with @dunglas to merge it in 3.1 instead of 2.7? If so, I must close this PR and open a new one.

looks ok as bug fix to me,
won't object if ends up in 4.1 (not 3.1)

If we merge it in 2.7, we'll be able to remove some code in API Platform, so üëç for 2.7 for me.

You don't need to create new PR, just edit this PR and change target branch.

Target for new feature can be master only

@ostrolucky But I cannot change the origin of my PR (which is currently 2.7), that's why I was saying to close & open a new PR. But @nicolas-grekas & @dunglas both agree for 2.7.

@vincentchalamon you can rebase and change the target branch from the GitHub UI (but 2.7 is fine here, indeed).
