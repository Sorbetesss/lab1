``getTransformationFailure`` must be implemented in Button too

What do you think about deprecating `isSynchronized()` and adding `hasTransformationFailure()` ?
Or renaming to `isDataSynchronized()`, because it's not obvious what is exactly synchronized in form

@shoomyth `hasTransformationFailure()` is a good suggestion actually! I'll look into it.

My only concern is the "yet another BC break in the Form component". I think that having interfaces that change in every single Symfony version do not help. Not having those interfaces in the first place would be in fact better.

@fabpot we have 2 implementations of the interface in core. And removing it would force breaking BC in all form types (as they typehint the FormInterface in ``buildView`` and ``finishView``).
If we can find a different way to handle buttons without relying on the interface, I would be in favor of dropping it in 3.0 though.

But the interface is meant for consuming it in userland, not for implementing it. I doubt anyone is crazy enough to reimplement the FormInterface in a different way in their project, and only these crazy people would be affected by this BC break.

Exactly. People are supposed to type-hint against the interface, not implement it. Our benefit is the flexibility to pass any implementation of the interface that we like, be it `Form`, `Button` or any other (some more will probably come in 2.7, because I think we can improve performance if we use simpler implementations than `Form` for simple fields).
