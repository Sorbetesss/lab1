No description, no test… I don't really know what to do with this change. 🤷🏻‍♂️

As I told in [another PR](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/52222), tests in this command are difficult.
This PR fix the display of context and extra data of log with Monolog 3.

I'm thinking about improving the command to integrate tests more easily.

@derrabus I added a description and justify why we can't test this command in the PR summary.

@derrabus PR could be reviewed with the additionals informations added in the PR description ?

> LGTM. I'm just wondering: does the `--filter` option work with v3?

Thanks for the approve.
I tested on monolog/monolog:3.5.0 and the `--filter` option works.
What is your doubt ?

I was wondering about the call to `$this->el->evaluate($filter, $record)`, whether $record was an array at this line. Looks like yes, thanks for confirming.
