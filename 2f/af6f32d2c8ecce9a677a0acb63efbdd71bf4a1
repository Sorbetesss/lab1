I'd love this feature. In a few big applications with 25+ developers, mistakes like this happen every once in a while. I love to see them crash instead of silently continuing.

As proposed by other people, i would prefer deprecate this and throw an exception in symfony 4.0.

@alexpott OK to replace this flag by a deprecation?

The failure in fabbot.io is on a line not changed by this patch - I guess src/Symfony/Component/Yaml/Tests/Fixtures/YtsSpecificationExamples.yml does not comply with the standard.

Please also update the upgrade files for 3.2 and 4.0.
