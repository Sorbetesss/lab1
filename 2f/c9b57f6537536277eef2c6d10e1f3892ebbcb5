Ahh. 2.3 is the first version to validate the basic auth part of a url. But that is failing due to the PHP5.3. Should I have made a PR against 2.7?

Yes, 2.7 is the lowest branch that is still maintained. 2.3 isn't maintained anymore.
It's not too late, you can rebase your branch against 2.7 and change the target branch of your PR (https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request).
