Thanks for jumping on this, @nicolas-grekas!

This fix works, in that it no longer breaks functionality. But it does look like it introduces a change in formatted output that puts empty spans in front of a lot of things:

Either that or this was introduced somewhere else but masked by the BC break in my tests.
