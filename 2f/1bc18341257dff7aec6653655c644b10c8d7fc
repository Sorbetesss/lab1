Removing the AS will fail with PostgreSQL <8.4 (if any one still uses this version).

@sstok Any idea how to handle it? I see there is a Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::getDriver() method which can be used to check database driver, but this method is not a part of Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Connection interface.

What's the status of this PR? Anyone willing to finish it?

I think its save to merge, the `AS` problem only applies for PostgreSQL <8.4 which is no longer maintained. The minimum version still supported is 8.4
