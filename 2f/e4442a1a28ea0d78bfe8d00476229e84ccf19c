Is this really a bugfix?

Ie, why not target 5.4?

To save some potential merge conflicts, and benefit from the work on the polyfill I guess.

> this is consistent with the way we introduced usage of get_debug_type where we relied on the polyfill in older branches too.

ooch, actually we added `get_debug_type()` only on recent branches! That reverses the argument, updating for 5.4... :)
