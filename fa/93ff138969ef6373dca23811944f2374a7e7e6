Can we ignore fabbot report here? Alignment is desired to me...

I don't think we should keep the alignment. If we apply some code formatting syntax, we should apply it always and without exceptions. Otherwise this will cause problems when running the php-cs-fixer in the entire codebase, which is done from time to time.

Just renamed the const to be even more explicit: `Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_AWS_ELB`
