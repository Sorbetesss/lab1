I'm not sure Propel follows semver good enough for this in version `1.*`...

Considering that Propel 1.6 is still the latest version and that there has been no recent activity on Propel, I don't see the need for the change. Let the Propel guys decide when see fit.

@fabpot The latest version is 1.7.1.

Maybe @marcj knows more about the versions and can take a look at this (if it's really an issue).

I used the same version constraint as in https://github.com/propelorm/PropelBundle/blob/1.4/composer.json#L13
