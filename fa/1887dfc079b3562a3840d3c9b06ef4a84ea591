The class the alias points to would be interesting

We need to remove the `--types` option from debug:container, right?
👍 for 3.4.

I'd like to keep it, and remove it later when we've thought more about what to do with the `debug:container` command in general. And as Stof pointed out, the new command does not have a `--format` option, on purpose, so that we have a bit more flexibility to change the command in the future (because we're not guaranteeing BC of the output of the new command). The `debug:container --types` *does* have an option, so people can continue to use that :).

I think I still like the independent `debug:autowiring`. But, it should be quite easy to deprecate & change this new command *if* that's what we want to do. It has a much lower BC-policy cost than most other pieces of code.
