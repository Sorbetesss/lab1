I haven't reviewed the code yet but I like the idea! Could we also allow to set this annotation on classes? In this case, the context will be applied to the class and all its properties.

Indeed, I also had this case in mind. I'd say let's polish this one first and iterate over. I don't think it would bring any compatibility issue (anyway we have time until 5.3 release).

Note that applying a context on an object property should already do it right now. But we miss a way to add it on class-level, for the root object for instance.
