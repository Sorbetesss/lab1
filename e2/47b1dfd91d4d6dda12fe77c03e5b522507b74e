Also I changed the previous fake-id from `"nope"` to a more readable `"n/a"`

@ro0NL

> also it should be translatable i guess ðŸ¤”

I want to answer it here, as this is an important point and I don't want to discuss it in a collapsed code comment.

I thought about that as well, but as the default placeholder (`{attr: { placeholder: "..." } }`) is both visible to the user and not translated by default as well, I didn't want to make this inconsistent here.
It would be weird if this field works differently from all other fields. WDYT?

@apfelbox  AFAIK we're already translating placeholders, ... and title attributes for that matter:

im guessing some composer constraint needs a bump for tests to pass :)

The `symfony/form` constraint already points to the next, not yet released version. What do we need to bump?
