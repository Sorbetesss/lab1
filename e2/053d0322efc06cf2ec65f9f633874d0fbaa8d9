I'd really love to do that, but the bridge is also used by projects outside of the Symfony org. Those projects would be locked in on 5.2 then.

Yes, but we never promised anything past our LTS versions. Having the bridge out of sync is a pain. We need to make our lives simpler from time to time, this is now :)
