This will fix the issue reported in #27707. However, I am not sure if it is really a good idea to process all the `Configuration` classes that we can reach through extensions. It could trigger the same wrong behaviour in other packages too.

lets skip those extensions / apply array_filter here:

it only validates env placeholders which are not present in empty configs anyway.
