what happens when you use a parameter as class name for the service (which is still supported even though we discourage its usage in the doc) ?

what happens when the service class matches multiple ``_instanceof`` ? and what happens for services defined using a factory ?

the class is resolved using the parameterbag already.
of course that can't account for params added later in compiler passes.
in that case (ie when the class is missing really), nothing special happens (ie we continue as usual).
See [ResolveDefinitionTemplatesPass.php](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21530/files#diff-d81a6a2f4968eb3c7d1511f42bdb8c79)

> what happens when the service class matches multiple _instanceof ?

they are applied on top of each others in declaration order

> and what happens for services defined using a factory ?

nothing special: we use the "class" attribute, which we deprecated not defining, so we can use "instanceof" even in the case of factories.
