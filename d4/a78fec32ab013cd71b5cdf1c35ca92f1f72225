AFAIU, it won't fix the specific issue you mentioned as the job is killed when idle for too long, it won't retry.

From their blog:

> #### Retrying Your Own Commands
If you're doing any custom installation of things from external resources, for instance to install Ubuntu packages, you can use this functionality as well. It's exported as a shell function in the build script.

> Instead of running `sudo apt-get install something`, make it `travis_retry sudo apt-get install something`.

I donâ€™t see how this can be a more precise example.

`travis_retry` will retry with an idle timer lower than the job itself.
