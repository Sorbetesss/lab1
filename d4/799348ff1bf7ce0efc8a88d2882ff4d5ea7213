It will look like this.

Would it be possible to show arguments of the setters as well? I think that
would be an even greater addition

It is possible. Still the command doesn't even show arguments for the debugged service itself. I would hope we can have this merged first and then save arguments support for service and calls etc. to another PR.

We would also need to consider if it's worth it e.g. private services as arguments will make output look really ugly and bloated.

Updated PR. Removed useless count check.
