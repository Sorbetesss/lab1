Hi @nicolas-grekas ,
The integration tests with travis do not work, but I do not understand why it fails, since I have not changed anything in the Mailer component.
The error it gives is the following:

```
1) Symfony\Component\Mailer\Tests\TransportTest::testFromDsnMailgun
TypeError: Argument 4 passed to Symfony\Component\Mailer\Bridge\Mailgun\Smtp\MailgunTransport::__construct() must implement interface Psr\Log\LoggerInterface or be null, instance of Mock_EventDispatcherInterface_fc379422 given, called in /home/travis/build/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Transport.php on line 104
/home/travis/build/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/vendor/symfony/mailgun-mailer/Smtp/MailgunTransport.php:25
/home/travis/build/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Transport.php:104
/home/travis/build/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Transport.php:58
/home/travis/build/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Tests/TransportTest.php:105
```
And from what I can see in the code as a fourth parameter, it is passing a mock of an LoggerInterface

Could you help me?

Thank you.

@ajcerezo are you planing to finish this PR?

Hello @OskarStark , I am sorry for the delay in the response at this time, I only have one problem with the integration tests in travis, but it is nothing of the code that I have touched, the exact comment of this problem is just above and I do not know why I fail . If you can help me, I imagine that it has been part of one of the rebase that I had to do to merge with the latest changes in branch 4.4.

The new functionality is finished.

I'm a DA with Couchbase. I think we'll add this PR to our monthly newsletter. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do to get this in front of Couchbase/PHP/symfony users?

Also, feel free to post a message on our PHP forum if you'd like: https://forums.couchbase.com/c/php-sdk
