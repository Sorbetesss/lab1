It *is* something we could think about - by adding some sort of a "fallback" transport - i.e. the transport to use if no other transports are matched. I think it's safe to do this later - 5.1, etc if we want to.

Only failure is because `symfony/doctrine-bridge:dev-master` tests are looking for the new `ConsumedByWorkerStamp` inside `symfony/messenger:dev-master`, but it won't be there until this is merged up to `master`. But if this is fixable by a `composer.json` constraint, let me know.
