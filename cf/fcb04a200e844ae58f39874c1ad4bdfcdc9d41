Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.1" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "all".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

We have a lot more README files with that issue. If we change it here, we should change it everywhere.

Agreed!  If it gets accepted I can do the rest as well.  If it's rejected
(I think it has been in the past), I won't bother.

But it's always bugged me.  clip, switch to terminal, paste, ctrl-a,
forward-arrow twice, backspace twice, enter.

If you have a link to a previous discussion, this might help getting a decision here.

Not sure -- I've submitted this issue to many repositories, but even if it
was rejected, it shouldn't be.  Nobody wants the $ in the clipboard when
they're pasting.

And the $ isn't even the prompt for windows, so it's not like it's so
important that we need to have it even though it makes it look like it
doesn't work.

It was discussed recently there https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-6-4-assetmapper-improvements

Maybe it is possible to filter this char for Windows users just before it‚Äôs copied into the clipboard ?
