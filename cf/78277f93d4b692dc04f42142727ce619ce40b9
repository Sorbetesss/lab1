Thanks for review, I changed the phpdoc and added a test to cover this.

PhpDoc and tests can effectively be merged in lower branch version. But removing the typeHint is a 4.0 issue... Should I open an other PR on a lower branch? @nicolas-grekas

Removing the type will come naturally when merging up to master I think.

I moved it to lower active branch 2.7.
