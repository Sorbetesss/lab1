Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.3" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "5.4".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Wasn't quite sure how the Changelog/Deprecation documentation was suppose to work so that is missing but should otherwise be good to go.

@stof Fixed the relevant fabbot changes.

Didn't touch this code so maybe should be handled else where?

Yes, that one you can ignore. But the `trigger_deprecation()` line fabbot complains about is your code. ðŸ™‚

Also, the failing tests appear to be related.

the test failure is because you forogt to update the assertion in the test when fixing the text of the deprecation message.

Fixed the test and that stray space that snuck in.

Somehow the tests are worse... There's a ton of fatal errors and failures that seem unrelated so hoping something changed elsewhere...
