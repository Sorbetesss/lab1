Imo the application level Resources should be loaded first.

You are right. I will update shortly.

And finally, would be good to cover this with tests.

@jakzal app Resources will now take priority. I had to sort it by Child bundles (and removed prepending) to ensure that the priority is correct.

@jakzal I am not too sure how to write tests for this use case as there will be no parent/child bundles to access from the tests?
