shoudn't this be handled by the escaping of backslahes already ? It is actually a matter of a backslash followed by another char

hmm, actually, we are only escaping doubled backslahes, which is wrong IMO. we should escape all backslashes to be safe

Btw, your own list is incomplete. There is more escaped chars in YAML: http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2776092

You're right. I tried escaping first which didn't work. But I guess that was simply a matter of where they have been placed.

I think it is a matter of replacing the first element to escape single backslahes

I modified the escaper. This should now work as expected.

And I added some more tests (mainly to ensure that constructs like `\t\\` or `\t\\\\` don't break).
