laminas/laminas-code does not support PHP 8.1 yet, so we cannot remove the `php 8.0.99` hack yet.

Yes, that's what I figured out, we should remove the hack once https://github.com/laminas/laminas-code/pull/86 is merged. Thanks @derrabus for working on that PR btw!

We would make this a `8.1.99` hack then that is only applied for the PHP 8.2 job.
