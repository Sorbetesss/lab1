Comments are addressed. I'll regenerate the expected return types file in a moment ðŸ™‚

Changed `self` return types to `static` in `SmsboxOptions` which resolved the return type issues. This should be ready now

Great work, I would prefer to remove the SmsboxMessage prefix from the enums, we have the namespace.

Agree @nicolas-grekas ?

`Enum` subnamespace?

I was skeptical to just have a `Day` or `Charset` enum for instance at the root of the component, but with an Enum subnamespace, I agree with the idea. I'm doing the change
