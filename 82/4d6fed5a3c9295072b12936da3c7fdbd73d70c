PR updated with php_apcu.dll from https://phpdev.toolsforresearch.com/php-8.2.6-Win32-vs16-x86.zip, thanks to @Jan-E!
~php_redis.dll doesn't seem to work so I removed testing redis on appveyor. We already have it in our integration tests anyway.~

Redis in my builds needs igbinary as well. If you build redis yourself on Windows, try `--disable-redis-igbinary`.

For the failing 8.3 test: igbinary does not compile yet, but apcu and redis do work:

Please note that I am still building with OpenSSL 1.1.1.
