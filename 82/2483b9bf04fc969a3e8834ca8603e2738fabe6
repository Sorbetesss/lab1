@fabpot, if we used COMPOSER as the var name, then other composer calls would fail:

(composer-dev.json is the alternative name for composer.json in my project).

I'm not sure at which point it fails, I could look in to it but I'll need some more time. Do you have any ideas why that fails?

@nicolas-grekas, I can confirm it works using "COMPOSER":

I updated the PR.
