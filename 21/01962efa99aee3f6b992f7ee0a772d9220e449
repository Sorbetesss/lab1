Please always rebase, we don't accept PRs with merge commits in their history.

Sorry, tried to rebase using GitHub UI but it ended in a merge commit :sweat_smile:
Should be good now.

We could deprecate `--all` and just clear all pools when the `pools` argument is not specified.

To me this could be done in a separate PR, while this has some implicit drawbacks IMHO, because you could clear more than expected ðŸ‘Ž

I would go with this PR as is
