If this feature will be merged, is it a good idea to register this processor in ``MonologBundle`` for all logs? Or else, maybe simply write a doc that explains its registration (containing something like [this](https://github.com/maidmaid/monolog-bundle/commit/b8341bdec47dfea0f590d9b2b87bd1d8369da409))?

Would this add the token to every log line? Because I don't want to see the token added 10x if my log contains 10 log lines to be honest.

The idea is great though, I'm using a custom formatter for the logging at the moment and I rather have this in the core.

@iltar Yes it will. That's how processor works.

But:

* This processor is not enabled by default
* You can add process on specific channel and/or handler.

I have improved token normalization that now is more json-like/readable:

```
[2016-12-29 14:48:09] app.INFO: admin connected! [] {"token":{
    "username":"admin",
    "auth.":true,
    "roles":["ROLE_ADMIN"]}
}
```

Thank you for your review @fabpot and @iltar. Changes are done.

You need to add the `security/core` package as a dependency to the `require-dev` section in the `composer.json` file of MonologBridge.

I updated the ``composer.json`` @xabbuh.

AppVeyor break tests are related?

AppVeyor Failure seems unrelated.
