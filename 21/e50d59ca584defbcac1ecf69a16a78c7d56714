@fabpot Any thoughts?

@fabpot Any chances to have this in 2.7?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@MAXakaWIZARD Why do we provide a style for columns and not rows? Would it make sense as well?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by MAXakaWIZARD at 2015-04-07T14:09:02Z

@fabpot Well, I described it in first comment. It is useful for numeric data, for example.

:+1: looks very nice. If we also wanted row styling, we could add that later.

@fabpot Should this PR target version  `2.8`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-10-06T13:04:29Z

2.7 is fine. I will merge it automatically in the 2.8 branch anyway, no need to rebase on current 2.8.

@fabpot @stof I've made changes to the code regarding your comments

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-10-06T14:45:26Z

Apart from my small phpdoc comment, :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by MAXakaWIZARD at 2015-10-06T14:48:59Z

@fabpot Done

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-10-06T14:50:11Z

Can you keep the dots as in my original proposal?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-10-06T14:51:01Z

In fact, I still prefer my version than yours.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by MAXakaWIZARD at 2015-10-06T14:55:35Z

@fabpot Sorry. Is it OK now?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2015-10-06T15:14:32Z

Looks good now. Can you rebase on current 2.7 to get rid of the merge commit? A simple `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/2.7` from your branch should be enough. Thanks for your patience.

by MAXakaWIZARD at 2015-10-06T15:20:15Z

@fabpot Done. It's only one commit finally.
