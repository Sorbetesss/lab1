@localheinz Can you please rebase on the current 5.x branch? That should fix the remaining fabbot issues

@chalasr

What is the usual policy here in regard to coding standard issues?

Looks like `fabbot.io`

- does not report all issues that can be observed when running `php-cs-fixer` locally
- reports additional issues that can not be observed when running `php-cs-fixer` locally

Honestly, I'm not sure to know how it works exactly :/
I guess fabbot does more than just running php-cs-fixer (or adds some additional custom logic/rules)
