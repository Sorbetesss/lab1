Tests pass everywhere now. In order for file names with non-ascii characters work on all platforms they need to be created from PHP (just like we do it in FileTest).

We can now also remove the fixtures file that is not used anymore, can't we?

It's used in the other test.

Hm indeed, can't we reuse the same approach in that test?

@xabbuh actually, the other test didn't need the file to exist, as only the file name is used there. I removed the fixture.

@symfony/deciders this PR, when merged, will fix the build
