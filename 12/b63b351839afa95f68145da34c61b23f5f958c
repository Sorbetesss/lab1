Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.1 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

@kbond   I did a first PR to Symfony project and had some issues:

1. why change from that files also was committed src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Bridge/Mailchimp/*
2. tests failed, but on local envirionment they skipped. How to set-up local env so test runs ok?

```1) Symfony\Component\Cache\Tests\Adapter\RedisAdapterTest::testCreateSocketConnection
Symfony\Component\Cache\Exception\InvalidArgumentException: Invalid Redis DSN: "redis://".```

Please help me!

Hey @alebedev80, thanks for contributing!

For (1), a few things:
1. Not exactly sure why these extra commits are included, did you perhaps merge 6.1 into your PR?
2. Regardless, 5.4 is where you want to make this change so fetch the latest 5.4 branch from this repo and [rebase your branch](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/pull_requests.html#rebase-your-pull-request) to it (including only your commits).
3. You'll then need to change the target of this PR to 5.4 (edit button near the PR title gives this option).

For (2), I think you'll need to run the test suite with the `REDIS_HOST` env variable set:

```
REDIS_HOST=... phpunit --group integration
```

I'm not positive though, let me know if that doesn't work.

@kbond test failed with an error:

```
1) Symfony\Component\Cache\Tests\Adapter\RedisAdapterTest::testCreateSocketConnection
Symfony\Component\Cache\Exception\InvalidArgumentException: Redis connection "redis:///var/run/redis/redis.sock" failed: No such file or directory
```

as i understand test envirionment start a Redis instance

1. where i can find Redis configuration?
2. what's a Redis's socket file path?

Thank you!
