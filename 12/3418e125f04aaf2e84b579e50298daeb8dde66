@tyx: Can you please re-add the header information? This is a requirement.

Many failures on travis seem unrelated : https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/568907222#L5407

Except one https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/568907222#L5422 but I guess it's a normal failure as it does not use the right `http_client` package (The failure is about loading the debug http client stuff in FrameworkBundle without loading the change in http_client)
