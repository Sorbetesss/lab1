For the upcoming hack day and if you find the time to review this for any issues I should fix, a short notice about that would be nice.

Type alias removed and rebased.

Apart some very minor comments, this PR looks awesome!

@HeahDude Thanks for your comments. Some of these stem from the fact that this PR was originally based on 2.7. I have updated it accordingly for 3.1+ now.

The in-linings would break the soft limit, so I left them out.

Can you inline even if it breaks the soft limit? We are not following any limits for line length.

@fabpot OK, done :)

@xabbuh I did this in sync with the existing classes, i.e. ``DateTimeToArrayTransformer``. Should I really change it only for this one (now)?

@MisatoTremor Let's do the change for this one for now.

@fabpot Done :)
