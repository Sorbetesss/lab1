Seems that tests in the Form component are failing on the 2.8 build.

@xabbuh #16033 should fix that.

some tests for deps=low are broken in the component (the error reporting is broken because of an issue in PHPUnit 4.8 on PHP 7)

See https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/16041 for the issue with PHPUnit error reporting on PHP 7

Rebased on current master to see if PHP7 issues are fixed by @stof phpunit version change for PHP7.

Let's stop here for now; not all deprecations are taken care of, but most of them are. The remaining are not trivial to handle and will be part of another PR.

Ready for review: ping @symfony/deciders

Tests are failing.

hopefully, tests pass now. Let's wait for Travis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tests pass. Not sure about PHP 7 though.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Tobion at 2015-10-01T14:57:44Z

there are only 3 failing tests now: 1 is fixed by #16050 and 2 other are unrelated security tests

Good to merge :+1:
