Hey!

Excellent, just like I would have done it.

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Could you please create a docs PR and a recipe? Thanks

I am not super confident with this component. But I think it looks alright.

It needs a rebase before we can merge it.
