i will complete the other language if you don't mind. But in any case if there is any miss spelling with the language you might know feel free to comment and do some review.

@andrerom could I ask you to spend a minute to confirm the Norwegian translations?

@sagikazarmark, could I ask you to double check the Hungarian translations?

I think @1ed 's comments are valid. There is one thing I disagree with: I think using imperative (`Adjon meg egy számot`) is better than leaving the word `Kérjük` there (as a direct translation of the word "please").

@1ed can you use the suggestion feature (when leaving a comment there is a button for that in the editor) for your comments to provide patches? Thanks!

@1ed Are you happy with the Hungarian now?

I will keep that in mind for the future. Thanks!
