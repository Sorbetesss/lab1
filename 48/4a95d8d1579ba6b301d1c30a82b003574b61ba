I'm not sure the failed `appveyor` build is related. All tests are `Ok`.

It looks like we have a similar issue in API Platform: https://github.com/api-platform/core/issues/3974
I wonder if this shouldn't be fixed once and for all in PropertyAccess (this doesn't prevent to merge this PR first).

PR welcome on PropertyAccess if someone is up to having a look there.
