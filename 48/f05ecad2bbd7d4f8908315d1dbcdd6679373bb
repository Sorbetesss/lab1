CI errors look unrelated.

I'm not sure the current `InvalidArgumentException` is a good idea. It prevents people to actually catch a `\TypeError` on PHP 7 as they are now wrapped with a new exception. In this sense it's also a BC break.
And the next question is why is it an `InvalidArgumentException` that extends from LogicException. To me it's more a RuntimeException as it seems impossible to detect such errors before runtime.

So I would propose to not cach `\TypeError` on PHP 7 and on PHP 5 throw a fake `\TypeError` from the polyfill.

@Tobion I like your approach. It's now implemented like that.
