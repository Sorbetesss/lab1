> Why on 3.4 and not on master btw?

PSR-3 should be the recommended way to interact with the logger in Monolog 1 already. Also, the tests don't differ much between 3.4 and master yet, so I thought it might be easier for the maintenance if I apply the change here.

But I can rebase to master, if you want me to.

Let's go on master, these tests are fine for 3.4 IMHO.
