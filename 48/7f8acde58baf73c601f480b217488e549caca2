Can we throw a deprecation when it returns null and adjust the signature to `: string` in 5.0? It doesn't make sense to return `null` here, you'd expect an exception in the URL generation.

This is the only case, and AFAIK intended to not throw. Currently `null` allows you to differ this case from a valid `""` URL. However im not sure we should care (it's logged) and perhaps we can always return string then... deprecting null first :angel:

At least in practice i think this null is already casted to string in app code.

I agree returning null does not make sense for this method. It could just be changed to an empty string when not strictRequirements

I agree with @Tobion

Would this be a bugfix then (target against 2.8 branch)?
