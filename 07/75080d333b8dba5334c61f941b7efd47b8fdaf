@nicolas-grekas Can you add a test so that we avoid any regressions in the future?

This is already tested (see the touch of the linked file after the link creation)

I think this breaks the `assets:install` command new fallback mechanism in certain cases discussed in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/11297

I have a pending PR where I put back the check into the command itself https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/13057/files#diff-8948f478796eebd6196480b10309a0a9R158, but I don't know if it is acceptable with the other changes I made or not.

@1ed patch updated, can you please check if that's ok now?

@nicolas-grekas It looks fine, but I can't test it as I don't have windows.
