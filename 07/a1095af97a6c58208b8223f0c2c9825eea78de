Can you paste some before/after screenshots?

The red text on dark background for the exception message does not have enough contrast to be readable (and this gets even worse for color-blind people). As that's the most important part of the content, that should be changed.

Is this one ready?

@stof I've added more contrast for the red color, not only for the exception title, but for all red text (ref updated pictures)
