Thanks for this Nicolas. Obviously, this is a one-off solution, but it IS one of the most common situations. So... are you thinking w could merg this and start with this alone? Or do you intend for this to turn into something bigger?

Implementation now ready with the full list of Twig functions/filters handled by the bridge.
@weaverryan yes, I think this is enough to close #25256 - we don't want to create "autoconf for PHP" (because this is what it could look like :) )

@xabbuh thanks, comments addressed.

> form_enctype() function is missing

deprecated in 2.3, removed in 3.0

> What about the filters from the CodeExtension?

http-kernel/foundation/routing are always installed with Flex, no need for special care
