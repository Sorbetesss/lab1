please add some tests, at least the failing case of #7480

@pborreli `ini_set()` does not work for `post_max_size` value, so I cant't test this feature.

@jfsimon but you can extend/mock class `ServerParams` and overwrite the `getNormalizedIniPostMaxSize()` method, so it will be able to return anything.

@jfsimon then maybe overwrite getNormalizedIniPostMaxSize ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@stloyd right, let's go.

@stloyd @pborreli really better with some tests, thanks.

@jfsimon How about adding `i` modifier, so we can have the same regex in all places and don't rely on `strto(upper|lower)`?

@lazyhammer I'd like to knwo what does @vicb think about that.

I don't care.

I think it's time to admit that this new way is just a fail and we need to revert to the previous way.

@fabpot we wont surrender now! everything is okay now.
