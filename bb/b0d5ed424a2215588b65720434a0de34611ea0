@nicolas-grekas updated the PR and added [this comment](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22239#discussion_r109961065).

@nicolas-grekas unfortunately your two-line change wasn't an option because of the `/` at the end. I've pushed a refactored version to allow this `/` not to be there when just using `**` without `/` after.

The built errored on Travis, could someone with super-powers could restart it? :)

Amend your commit and then force push (with the branch name) and should restart Travis üëç

Can you add a note in the CHANGELOG?

@fabpot don't you think that [@nicolas-grekas' one](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Finder/CHANGELOG.md#330) already for 3.3.0 is enough?
