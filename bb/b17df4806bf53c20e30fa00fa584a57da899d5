Looks like you opened your PR against the wrong branch or forgot to rebase it.

@lyrixx

Q: how often do you release patches?

Is there a specific timeline for v3.2.5?

(new to symfony dev cycle, couldn't find this detailed anywhere..)

@izzyp we do patch releases once a month (except when a security issue requires us to release an extra one faster)
