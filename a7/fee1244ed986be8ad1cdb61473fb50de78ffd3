@Triiistan could you please rebase to trigger tests again?

Fixed a typo + rebased again

Shouldn't this be merged into older branches? It can be seen as a bug fix as having to repeat the class under the alias item seems useless.

I did that because the current behavior is [already documented](https://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/validation/custom_constraint.html#constraint-validators-with-dependencies), so I supposed this was a new feature. But I agree with you that it looks like a bug fix.

It's indeed documented as being required, so making that optional is not really a problem IMHO.

This contribution looks finished. Do Symfony mergers want @Triiistan to create a new pull request against 2.3 .... or can you merge this into older branches? Thanks!
