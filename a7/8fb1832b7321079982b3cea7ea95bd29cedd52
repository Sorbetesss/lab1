I don't see how the test failures are related to this PR, let me know if anything else is needed

Can you add a test to cover this bug?

I can reproduce the bug with a small terminal window. I can confirm via a manual test that the upstream change does resolve the issue.

I added a unit test. You can see it failing in the [test-only commit](https://travis-ci.com/github/symfony/symfony/jobs/490641898) and then [passing after the fix](https://travis-ci.com/github/symfony/symfony/jobs/490642699).

(both commits fail the full test suite due to some unrelated issue on the 4.4 branch)
