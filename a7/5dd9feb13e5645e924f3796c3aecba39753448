We would also need to update the docblock of the `ConfigurableRequirementsInterface` where `null` is explicitly documented.

This should be merged in 3.4 if we consider it as a bug fix.

After thinking about it a bit more, I would rather merge it in master and add a note in the changelogs about the change.

@eborges78 Can you rebase on current master instead of merging? Merge commits forbids us from merging the PR. Thank you.
