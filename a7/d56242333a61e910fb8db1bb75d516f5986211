Replacing `ini_set` by `$this->iniSet()` looks like a very good idea, can you do this change in all test files as I suppose it makes sense to always use it, right?

Double :+1:, one for the PR and one for using `$this->iniSet()` everywhere

I replaced `ini_set()` with `$this->iniSet()` where applicable for all tests in 2.3. Would it be better to make a separate PR instead of using this one?

There are some tests in later versions that should probably be changed as well, not sure how that should be handled.
