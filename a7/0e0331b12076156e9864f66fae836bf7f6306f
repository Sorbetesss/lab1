The var line 115 will always be defined, there isn't any bug here to me.
Anyway, :+1: for the readability improvement then ;)

Woops !
Actually the bug is in 3.2... I've digged in the previous versions a bit too fast.
if you look in 3.2, there is a bug because of a third condition placed just before `$mode` computation
