What's the reasoning for this change? Shouldn't we do this on 6.3 only?

We could ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But I do not really see a reason to keep dead code in a script that we only use to execute the Symfony test suite.

the phpunit bridge still supports PHP 7.1.3+, so this is not dead code

This file is not part of the bridge.

But this file is also used when running the tests of the bridge IIRC
