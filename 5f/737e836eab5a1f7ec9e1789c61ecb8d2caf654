Problem with this is that link will be now inaccessible for users not using terminal which supports hyperlinks

@ostrolucky true. I think that's fine personally: most common terminals handle the links already and windows didn't make it clickable anyway.

yeah not a big deal in this one case, it's really minor inconvenience
