@chalasr where ? I was not able to find usage and tests are OK

@lyrixx https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.4/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Guard/Authenticator/AbstractFormLoginAuthenticator.php#L77 and https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/3.4/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Authentication/DefaultAuthenticationSuccessHandler.php#L110
(tests aren't ok, see travis)

Seems relevant for AbstractFormLoginAuthenticator only starting from 4.1.

Arf! Sorry. Indeed I mixed Symfony versions. Should be better now
