Well, solving a complain about one page being uncachable by keeping it uncachable for a different reason does not seem to solve it.

@stof at least this would make it explicit about *why* this is not cached, and also would prevent messing up with users' Cache-Control headers. So far better IMHO.

Yup, @nicolas-grekas' point was my reasoning behind it. Note that Travis' error is unrelated.
