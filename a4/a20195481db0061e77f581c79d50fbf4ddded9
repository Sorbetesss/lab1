Added a second commit that removes a sync script that is not used anymore (since the redesign of the web profiler).

What about adding this change to the upgrade file? Someone might reference them for whatever reason in their own code.

@xabbuh good idea, I've just added the change to the CHANGELOG file (same in #19997 between).
