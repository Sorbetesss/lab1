(@bocharsky-bw thanks for proposing this improvement ... I've taken it into account for the upcoming redesign of the exception pages)

@bocharsky-bw you can achieve it today too thanks to the ``--after-context`` option of ``grep`` to display additional context lines after each matched line:

```bash
curl localhost/any-path-which-throws-uncaught-exception | grep '<h1>' -A 1
```

And it's better to use `grep '<h1'` instead of `grep '<h1>'`  in case the `<h1>` someday adds CSS classes or HTML attributes.

Ah, didn't know about `--after-context` - it helps a lot in my case. Thanks @stof !

Completely agree with Javier.

@bocharsky-bw I just discovered it as well. But I was quite sure that someone already thought about adding such feature in grep. And so ``man grep`` told me about it.
