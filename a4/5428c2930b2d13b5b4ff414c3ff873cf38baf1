So.. any thoughts on this? I think this is way more obvious than the current approach.

The list command not giving the application-wide options is a bug.. right? However they were more or less explicitly left out... any opinion on this?

edit: yeah.. after #20090 and rebase 2.7 imo.

Not sure about intentions here. It's done rather explicitly. The global options do work though with `list`.

Tested the changes on 3.4 and this approach seems to be working properly.

@ro0NL I'm digging the old PRs right now and stumbled on this one. I see that you marked it as "Needs work", is it still relevant?

@fabpot i'd say yes. It boils down to

```
bin/console list -h
# does NOT show global options

bin/console about -h
# does show global options

bin/console help -h
# does show global options
# includes an arbitrary "command" argument, e.g.;
#
#   Arguments:
#     command               The command to execute
#     command_name          The command name [default: "help"]
```

Not sure why i marked it "needs work" :sweat_smile: i figure to come to some sort of conslusion here.

Ok, can you rebase on current master? I will test it on a real application to see how it behaves.

@fabpot should be good. ~~Only need to update fixture files still (please do :joy:)~~
