We should probably mention this BC break in the CHANGELOG file though

Either it's a BC break or it's a bugfix, but not both.
If we consider this a BC break, we should merge it as a feature and document in the CHANGELOG. Otherwise, it should just be merged as-is with no CHANGELOG update.

Do libs impacted by the previous behavior change that this PR aims to fix (psysh, tinker) have changed their code meanwhile? That may help taking the right decision here.

`psysh` didn't change the way it parse options
https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh/blob/29ad19f99ece710577ec9f9022276254f4c8f03e/src/Configuration.php#L239-L246

Switching `false` to `null` fixes their issue because they don't use strict comparison.
