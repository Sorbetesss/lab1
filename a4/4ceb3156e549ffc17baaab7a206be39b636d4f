There is also a slight BC break if someone access the Date header from the bag directly...

I've added lazy date header initialisation in `getDate`. It should fix the tests.

There is a BC break for people who accessed `$request->headers->getDate` after request construction. The header will now not be set anymore. But I guess this is an edge case. People relying on it didn't respect the HeaderBag anyway which assumes headers are optional.

@Tobion That's the BC break I mentioned above, but I think we can ignore this use case. But of course, that's also why it should only be merged in 2.8 and not on earlier branches.
