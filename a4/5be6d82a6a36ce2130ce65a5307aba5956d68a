I don't know if this can actually happen in real life, but those changes won't differentiate anymore the `PHP_AUTH_USER` header being `null` from being absent. Which is probably the reason why it was written as it is (Of course, I agree the situation would be weird).

Otherwise 👍

@ogizanagi Yep. But before changes u cannot differentiate PHP_AUTH_USER header being false from absent xD

So, the real question is: what kind of values can never be there, so that we can treat them as "no values". `null` seems to be a good default one, unless it's somehow special here. I don't know. Tests pass. PR is open ;-)

What's the benefit of this change?

Less WTF while reading the code.
