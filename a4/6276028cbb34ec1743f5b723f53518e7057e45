> I don't know how you work on symfony

1) goto my project
2) goto my fork; `cd var/sf-src`
3) `link ../..`
4) optionally go back to project; `cd -`

i think this change is fine. Perhaps check if we exec `link` in the symfony clone, then using the current working dir is unexpected, as it will link to itself (at least this part changes)

edit: not sure we have to care about that actually
