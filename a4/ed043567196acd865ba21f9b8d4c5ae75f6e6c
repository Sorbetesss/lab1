"Galioja" would be better when talking about expiration date.
Valid and appropriate basically both means "tinkamą".

Which translation are you concerned about?

When I was using google translate (which are wrong time to time), most translations said "choose an **appropriate** file", etc.

I just wanted to confirm that Google translate was wrong and that you just didnt make a misstake.

Im happy with this. Thank you 👍

Even though Im not a lithuanian language teacher, but for me "tinkamą" sounds and means better in this exact sentence 😅
