I made other attempts to find "the best" formatting. What do you prefer?

Looks like the `C` is the favorite one ! :heart: it's mine too.

This PR is now ready for the review ;)

Quick question: would it be possible to fallback to the old way when vardumper is not installed?

It's not really easy (but not impossible) since the `ConsoleFormatter` does not extend the `LineFormatter` anymore. It just implements the interface.

We can create two `ConsoleFormatter` implementation (the new and the old one). Then the `ConsoleHandler` can choose and the "best" one. (What about the naming ?)

Another solution is to extends again the LineFormatter.

What is the best option to you?

@lyrixx, I think we still need to support the case where `var-dumper` is not installed as we are trying to limit the required dependencies.

> @lyrixx, I think we still need to support the case where var-dumper is not installed as we are trying to limit the required dependencies.

I pushed a new version: Now if the var-dumper component is not installed, the context and the extra are not dumped at all.

I chose to do that in order to **keep the code as simple as possible**.

I could also extends the NormalizeFormatter, but there is lot of code in the LineFormatter. So I don't think it worth it.

Last thing, can you add a note in the CHANGELOG?
