`$defaultLocale` argument replaced by an option.

Not sure about the change: the option is not optional (it's required ;) ), which means the 4th arg is now mandatory also, but the signature tells the contrary. WDYT @fabpot ? Was that what you had in mind?

My point was just that we already have an `$options` array with 3 different keys and that adding a 4th one for the locale seemed natural to me and allowed to keep BC.

Given it would be the only mandatory option and we would have to provide an equivalent BC layer in both cases, I changed it back to an argument.
