This seems legitimate.
The drawback is that it computes variables several times if you have several attributes in the matching. But to be honest, I neevr saw any piece of code passing several attributes to the authorization manager (and it is even less likely to pass several expressions). So I don't think it is an issue.

However, Travis tells me that the functional tests of the SecurityBundle are broken.

@stof: it now computes the variables only once.
