It looks like this PR contains unrelated commits. Could you do a rebase against master?

Oops used GitHub desktop, which did something unexpected to the rebase. Should be ok now

Thanks noticing and letting me know about those @derrabus

The added method makes it easier to check what data formats the clients accepts, ex:
```
if (in_array('html', $request->getAcceptableFormats())) {
  // return html data, maybe a template
} elseif (in_array('xml', $request->getAcceptableFormats())) {
  // return xml
} else {
  // return json data
}
```

If this is useful and included in next release, I'll make the addition in documentation repo as well

@AndreiIgna would you mind rebasing and moving the line in the changelog on 4.2?

Yes sure, is updated now

Updated based on last review.

While checking in more detail the similar `$acceptableContentTypes`, saw that it's assigned null on `initialize` and `duplicate` methods. Added this for `$acceptableFormats` too, hope this is ok
