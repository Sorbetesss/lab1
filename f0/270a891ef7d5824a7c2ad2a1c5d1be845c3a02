Could you please check if that happens for other components also?

For other components we did this in 3.3. Should we merge the PR into the `3.3` as a bugfix?

@nicolas-grekas Serializer is also affected. I can enable the component without having it installed and FrameworkBundle would register the `serializer` service, but it's impossible to wire it.

I've also checked the validator: When enabling it, `FrameworkExtension` complains about the missing Translation component, which is not wrong, but seems a bit odd. However, if the Translation component is present, I get the expected exception about the missing Validator component.

Do you think, we can remove those lines?

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4c930284acdde24946e1322f02c34c6b2b7cf631/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/DependencyInjection/FrameworkExtension.php#L181-L183

Installing Validator without Translation is not possible, enabling validation without the Validator component will be caught elsewhere. So this block just generates a confusing error message.

3.3 it is, then.
