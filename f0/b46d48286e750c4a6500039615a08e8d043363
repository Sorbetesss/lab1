If you want to register your command as private service, you don't need to add "console.command" tag, because command won't work with standard interface.

What do you mean @unkind?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Console application from the FrameworkBundle requires public services: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Console/Application.php#L123
This tag ("console.command") is needed for the FrameworkBundle only (right?).
So what's the point to allow private services tagged with "console.command"?

Did you take a look at the changes ?

A public alias is always registered with a command so I thought it would be better to use it instead of its original service id.

My bad, didn't notice an alias, sorry.

Looks sensible to me. :+1:

BTW we can also do that for the event listeners and some other tags but we would need to create aliases (whereas here as they already exist), should I include it in this PR?

In order to get things merged quickly, I think it's better to create a new PR for the other tags. However, I think it'll be great to allow private services for listeners and such.

@stof @fabpot this PR received three :+1: from core developers and no :-1: so I guess this can be merged, no?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Ener-Getick that's correct. Please be patient, the mergers often scan through the Status: Reviewed PRs to merge new PRs. However, they are still volunteers and have a huge amount of issues and PRs to manage :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Ener-Getick at 2016-03-13T21:11:01Z

@WouterJ sorry as I don't know how you manage the PRs/issues (it could be the subject of an article btw) and as I know how easy it is to forget a notification, I thought it would be better to ping them directly :-)
Thank you a lot for your work !

Don't worry, you're doing a great job!

Managing PRs is not much different than how regular contributors do it: Scanning through the list on github and finding PRs ready to merge/vote/review. As a side note, I'm not a Symfony Core Team Member, just a documentor :)
