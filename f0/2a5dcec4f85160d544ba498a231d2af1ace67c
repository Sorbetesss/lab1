Can you also create the PR for the docs?

Don't you have to set the default value of the `name_converter` option to `serializer.name_converter.camel_case_to_snake_case` so that it is taken by default? Otherwise, the service were only used in the tests.

No. If you do that everything will be converted by default and this is not intended nor a best practice.

The name converter definition is here just for convenience and will be removed during the container compilation when not used.

Code updated and doc added (symfony/symfony-docs#5483)
