Could you please update the test according to this class ?

This is a duplicate of #18788 right?

@ro0NL This is a dup of that PR.  I should have looked harder as I didn't see that one when I created this one.  Happy to move things along on this one though if desired.

@Simperfit I've updated the tests accordingly.

Looks like some builds are not passing.  I hypothesize that it's due to this line:
`@requires extension mongo or mongodb` not actually causing the test to be skipped when it may need to be.

Has anyone done an "or" in a require statement before or does anyone know of a better way to accomplish this or any other thoughts?

@omanizer sure, just check the feedback from that one, looks like @fabpot wants to move on with this.

As there is no feedback on #18788, @omanizer can you finish this one instead of closing it? You can also get some inspiration from the other PR if that makes sense for you.
