Taking it strictly the current behaviour is not wing as the `TableCell` constructor documents that it expects a string. In the other hand does this change not do any harm. So +0 from me on the proposed change.

Looks like a feature to me, it is the expected behavior on 2.7.

I would only cast for ints then.

@jaydiablo Can you make the change @fabpot asked for? :)

Sure, what about other numeric values that aren't ints?  Like a float.

Should we wrap the cast in something like:

```php
if (is_numeric($value) && !is_string($value)) {
```

?

My point was that I don't want to have a cast to a string for objects for instance.
