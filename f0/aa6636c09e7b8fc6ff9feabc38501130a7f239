but shouldn't we allow it ? It would be useful in case some config treats null as being "don't enable this feature", which is the case for the database_url in Doctrine (allowing to configure with username/password/host locally when not setting the URL)

Could be, but should be allowed for all parameters then (for consistency, and because we use the same code paths for all params, env or not)

normal parameters (non-env-based) allow to store ``null`` (they also allow to store arrays, contrary to env parameters)

Indeed, I messed up here :) Fixed!
