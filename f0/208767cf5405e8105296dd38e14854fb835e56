JSON can only be `null|string|number|array|\stdClass` in PHP (classes and interfaces aren't supported). Maybe it is worth it to return this union type instead of nothing?

@dunglas That would be `null|string|int|float|array|object` considering the existing built in types in the PropertyInfo Type class. That would still fix the bug however and seems more consistent. Is that alright for you?

@nicolas-grekas Does your approval mean you prefer to return nothing?
