It looks like you're trying to hide a problem in `FileProfilerStorage`. Do you know why there is invalid rows in the file?

I think it only occurs when the file is very big. Or maybe when multiple client requests the backend at same time

The root issue seems to be the same as #50816.

In this exemple (6.2.12), I dump everytime a line is writed in the .csv and look the line with only a "0", it corresponds with neither dump
