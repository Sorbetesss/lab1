Thanks for the PR.
I think this first has to be a bugfix for 5.2.

As you pointed out, this info is only relevant when the new authenticator system is not in use.
Could you update your patch to remove it only if `enable_authenticator_manager` is `true`? And revert the removal of `FirewallConfig::allowsAnonymous()`, as it will need to be deprecated first when the old system will been removed (in 6.x).
