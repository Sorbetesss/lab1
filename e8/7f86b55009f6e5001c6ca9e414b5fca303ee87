Before spending more time here: is it worth it?
This looks like a lot of code, for something that is of low value to me.

most part of changes are tests.
abstract argument definition looks more clear and obvious and I'd like to continue

> and ContainerBuilder should throw an exception when it encounters one when creating a service.

@nicolas-grekas, what if specific pass will be registered in removing passes list, like DefinitionErrorExceptionPass, to check an abstract argument existence? and this pass will throw an exception, if an abstract argument is not replaced yet

if this behavior is suitable, do dumpers still have to able to deal with abstract arguments?

> the YamlLoader and YamlDumper should also be able to deal with abstract arguments

example for yaml config
```
    App\Test\Test:
        arguments:
            $a: !abstract should be defined by TestPass
```
tags functionality looks suitable
