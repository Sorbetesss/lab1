@jfsimon, you probably mis-read my comment, the code needs **to be reverted.**

@vicb What's wrong with this solution? I need to understand.

- What was wrong with the previous (working) solution ?
- The current look of your code.

I don't think anybody will ever use a form to upload TB of data, but anyway "t" is not supported (I think the sames goes for "b")

Okay. What about octal/hexadecimal values? Don't they need to be supported?

Good point. You should ask @fabpot.

I'm the one who asked @jfsimon to use this new way. Before the last comment of @jfsimon, I was inclined to agree with @vicb and revert the change. But @jfsimon had a good point, so I think the new way is indeed better as it covers more cases.

Is it ready to be merged?

@fabpot Yes.
