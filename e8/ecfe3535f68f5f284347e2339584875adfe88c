@fabpot Sorry, this was supposed to be part of https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/27648 but got missed due to a messed up force push.

~~I've based this PR on `4.3`, is that ok?~~

rebased to `4.4`

This PR was based on the version approved by @jderusse  https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/1f4d601ff4fe93a9dcf7402a34f497dc830a95c9

which had a failing test (we last minute removed the return index name from `MongoDbStore::createTtlIndex`).

I have then fixed that failing test 71091fab5e..d319a2a0ca

Please target ~master~ 4.4, that's a new feature for sure.

Will squash etc once you're all happy

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@nicolas-grekas can we merge this one?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kralos at 2019-08-22T04:28:55Z

`git rebase origin/4.4` and squashed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one looks ready for Symfony 4.4/5.0 👍

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@nicolas-grekas can you let me know if you're happy for this to be merged? I'll rebase/squash etc if everyone is happy. The appveyor CI failure is not Lock component by the way...

```
Testing src\Symfony/Component/HttpClient

1) Symfony\Component\HttpClient\Tests\CurlHttpClientTest::testToStream
Symfony\Component\HttpClient\Exception\TransportException: Couldn't connect to server for "http://localhost:8057/".

> Could you update the `StoreFactory` to add the `MongoDB\Client` and `mongodb://` in the list of managed DSN.
> Need to update the `CHANGELOG.md`

In order to add `MongoDbStore` support to `StoreFactory` the `MongoDbStore::__construct` needs to be able to construct without `$options`.

I have therefore added support for passing a `MongoDB\Collection` to `MongoDbStore::__construct`.

I have also added DSN support to `MongoDbStore::__construct`.

Neither `Client` nor DSN alone will be enough to construct a `MongoDbStore` as the `database` needs to be specified in `$options` therefore `StoreFactory` only supports `MongoDB\Collection`.

`CHANGELOG.md` has been updated.

CI is currently passing (the errors from travis are related to components other then `Component\Lock`). All `Component\Lock` tests are passing.

I've left the commit history for review purposes, if we are happy with the current iteration let me know and I can squash (if required).

@jderusse happy with current implementation? want me to squash?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kralos at 2019-11-20T03:34:39Z

@nicolas-grekas can we get this merged? do you need a squash first? I don't want to miss `v4.4`
