Master then is 4.3 now so yes, this should target 4.3. But can we have a deeper analysis so that we better understand what's going on? The reverted PR had merits I suppose.

I'm in favor of reverting in the meantime, this change looks to impact badly most API Platform projects.

From the profile, it seems the reverted PR caused many many cache lookups and writes.
