Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

The referenced issue mentioned 5.4, should this PR target 5.4 too?

Ah indeed, my bad I forgot 5.4 is still supported.
