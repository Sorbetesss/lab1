I'm fine with bumping. However, we could get around it by skipping the new tests if `TagHeader` is not present, couldn't we?

We could indeed. I tend to prefer bumping over adding a skip condition here, but both work for me. Let me know about your preference

PR updated, now skips the problematic test based on class existence.

Yes, I think that's better. We bump the dependency on the 6.0 branch anyway and can remove the skip condition there.

I think, the commit message and PR title deserve an update. Apart from that, let's merge to make the CI green again.
