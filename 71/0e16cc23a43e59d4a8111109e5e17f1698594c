I will make the documentation once this is merged. I also noticed an error in the doc of another transport.

I would not touch the other bridge in this PR; let's just add this as a new bridge. No need to deprecate the code IMHO, we can abandon the whole package via packagist.

WDYT @fabpot ?

Well, triggering a deprecation when someone configures a mailer DSN using the `sendinblue` schemes is needed to help them migrate.

If we only abandon the package, projects removing the old bridge without updating their env variables in prod would get a broken project due to using an unsupported scheme.
Side note: I would even wait a bit before marking the package as abandoned as FrameworkBundle 5.4 and 6.3 won't support the Brevo bridge (it does not register it as a supported factory) while the SendinblueBridge technically still works thanks to the BC layer of the API itself (where the old domain still works). We cannot mark a package as abandoned only for some versions and not for others.

I agree with @stof , we can abandon Sendinblue later. I will keep the deprecations on this PR and on the one of the notifier (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/50296)
