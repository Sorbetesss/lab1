The name `allowExtraChars` does not seem clear to me if it is actually about allowing brackets. When seeing it, I would have no idea what the extra chars are.

@eborges78 Can you rebase to get rid of the merge commit?

Do we really need an option for that? Why would you not allow it?

I did not want to alter the existing behavior of the UrlValidator.
Do you think this option can be removed?

I would vote for having this by default with no options. WDYT @symfony/deciders?

I agree with Fabien. According to [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) the following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a well-formed URI reference into its components:

```
^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?
```

This is the query string part -> `(\?([^#]*))?`  So nothing prevents using `[` and `]` and, therefore, we shouldn't treat them as a special thing.
