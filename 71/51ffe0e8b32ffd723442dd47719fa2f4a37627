Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Hi @hluup. Thanks for this contribution. I think it's OK to leave this open, but without the draft status.
It's already great to have some messages translated already, you don't have to do all of them in a single PR.

Everything should be translated now.
