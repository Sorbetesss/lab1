You mean I should create new PR against the 2.3 branch? No problem, sorry I didn't do it right away. I'm not yet familiar with symfony workflow.

No problem. Fabien, has a tool to merge it in 2.3 even when the PR is not for 2.3.

This is OK for this time. Fabien will be able to apply it automatically in 2.3. But for bigger changes, it is easier to send them directly to the right branch. This means master for new features and the oldest affected (and maintained) branch for bug fixes.

Ok, I'll leave this as is and try to do better the next time. :-)
