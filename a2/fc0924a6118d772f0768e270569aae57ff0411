Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.1" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "7.1 for features".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

it could be a valuable addition indeed,
but this reminds me a [discussion of mine](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/35535) (other account)

I also saw #53923.

I currently find the LockableTrait really confusing because when using it (without reading the code inside) you could expect that the trait use the default configured lock factory instead of creating a new one.

I was trying to improve the situation...

Yes and you do good i think but may it will leverage discussion
Perhaps create another trait and name it specifically ?
and yes iâ€™ve also seen the issue discussion and the doc and/or the class can be improved to give more context to the dev
