BTW my PR already [fixes that](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/19750/files#diff-b60d32b35c3a2ab2d7c1b76df7ab6f60R494) but does a lot of stuff at the same time.

As we're already in a release candidate status for 3.2, adding new features is not possible. If you have a better fix, just let me know @Ener-Getick . This patch solves an issue in the current version

~~Then let's wait for 3.3, but i don't think making invalid something that should be valid is a solution.~~

:+1:
at least we won't miserably fail with a PHP Warning :)
and throwing a parse error for a syntax not supported by the current parser is fine for now IMHO.

I reviewed your pr again and it looks like indeed that the input you test resulted at least in a warning as @nicolas-grekas said.
So i'm üëç for this, it can't hurt (it should probably be merged in 2.7).

Checked: this is for master only, 2.7 already fails properly here, the strpos is new to 3.2.

See #20388 on 2.7
