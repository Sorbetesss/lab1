I tend to think that this is for 6.3.

I see your point. My app is running in 5.4 so "to me", it's kind of a bug cause I can't start it.
But this kind of modification may not be wanted to all apps and may be considered as a feature.

Tell me what best for you. If you want it in 6.3, I'll fix my own app and override manually this warmer.
