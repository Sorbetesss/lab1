FYI there is no need open a new pull-request, you can switch the target branch of the pull-request after creating. You will however need to rebase and/or cherry-pick the commit(s) to prevent unrelated commits (from the previous target branch) are still included.

See also: http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html
Don't worry if this is to complex as in most cases the maintainers can merge to another branch, without you having to-do anything.

Just some helpful information for your next contribution üëç
