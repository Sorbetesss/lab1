Hey!

I think @Th3Mouk has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

It would still makes more sense to me if the test was in `AbstractObjectNormalizerTest` instead of `AbstractNormalizerTest` :pray:

are the tests that are failing now something on my end? I could rebase on 6.0 if desired

Thanks. The tests look good to me.
