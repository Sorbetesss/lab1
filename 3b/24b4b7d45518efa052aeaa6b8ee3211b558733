To me, this kind of discovery is better handled using keywords than using the type (which has a single value).

Updating the type still makes sense to me: e.g. `symfony-messenger-bridge` is a better type description than `symfony-bridge` to me.

On packagist there is a filter on tags, not on type. How would you search a package on its type?

https://packagist.org/?query=symfony-bridge does not return symfony packages.

@GromNaN packagist has both a filter by type and by tags (packagist's name for keywords). But the `query` parameter is about searching by name.
