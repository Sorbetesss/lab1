I'm wondering if we should do this at a higher level. Having a jitter is probably a common need for most triggers.

I've updated this PR to add a `JitterTrigger` that can add a _jitter_ to any trigger. Also, added `RecurringMessage::withJitter()` to help with DX (description updated to show usage).
