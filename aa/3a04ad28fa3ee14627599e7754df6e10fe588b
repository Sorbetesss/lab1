👍 but... that's a BC break.

A 301/302 in response of a POST to add a trailing slash doesn't work already. It's just silent now, but still badly broken.

This now fixes the same issue with scheme-based redirections.

For this there is 307 HTTP status code

> This status code is similar to 302 (Found), except that it
      does not allow changing the request method from POST to GET.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.7

I'm ok to change it to 405 as bug fix but in master it should be changed to 307 IMO.
