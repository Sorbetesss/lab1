Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "7.1" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.4".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

How can i tell fabbot to _not_ add Licence or correct typo in the generated files ?

By "original" you mean the one implemented previously ?

The problem i see: it was not the same between locales (as soon as parent/child where involved), and a new child addind a translatation for a given emoji would change the message.. and its position in the array.

I mean the order implemented previously yes, which is the order found in the source IIRC.

The previous files were not ordered like the source ones, they were ordered by mb_strlen then source order.

```
$codePointsCount = mb_strlen($emoji);
$mapsByLocale[$locale][$codePointsCount][$emoji] = $name;
```

And that order was kept only when no parent/child locale was involved

I can mimic this behaviour to build the "model map" if you want

I like reducing diffs so if you can then yes please :)

Much better now indeed ... only the "child locales" have been updated

As they were the only one concerned by the two problems (arrows instead of messages, and missing parent messages) this is much more logical.

Thanks ;)
