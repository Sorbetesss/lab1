Is this supposed to be a bugfix or a new feature?

@xabbuh, these changes are closer to a new feature than to bug fixes.
This allows the validator working with traversable results (which include doctrine collection), and not only with iterators and arrays.

:+1: I would consider this a bugfix rather than a new feature.
