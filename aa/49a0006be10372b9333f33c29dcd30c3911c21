Oops, adding "BC Break" label must be a mistake (that's either me leaving BC Break row with "yes/no" when submitting PR or just mentioning BC break in PR description text). I'd appreciate it being removed.

Looks like CI consoles enable formatting. I'll do more cleanup for irrelevant sequences and update PR.
