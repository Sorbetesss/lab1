Hey!

I see that more good work is coming your way.

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

@OskarStark

A bug fix would be great, since the corresponding application can not yet upgrade to `symfony/translation:^5`.

I know, from my perspective it can be considered a bugfix, as you explained it is conform with the spec üëçüèª
