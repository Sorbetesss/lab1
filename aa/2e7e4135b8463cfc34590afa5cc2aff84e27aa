You need to update the VoterFixture class to implement ``supports`` (or to get rid of the class). Otherwise the testsuite is broken.

@stof fixed by https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/15932 (wrong tests made it into the 2.8 branch)

@WouterJ Can you finish this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fabpot done. I've also removed `AbstractVoter#isGranted()` now

hmm, I've not checked, but I'm pretty sure they are some tests that need to be updated, no?

Indeed, found some other tests and removed them as well

@WouterJ Looks like `property-access` is not in the `composer.json` (it's not even in 2.8 apparently)

@fabpot that's a bug introduced in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/16007 and fixed in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/16030 and not related to this PR, neither can I relate the other build failures to this PR.
