I ran into this in Drupal 8 â€” thanks to @alexpott for filing this PR!

Why is this needed? The count displays the sum of all below messages, which can be big, so it looks useful to me, don't you?

Well changing the message resulted in a developer hitting a brick wall. Changing error messages even to just remove a fullstop is a bit unexpected. Maybe we could reverse the count so it comes first?

Also I'm not really sure how useful the overall count actually is.

I can answer that: it's a rough measure of progress when upgrading - can even be encouraging to see that number decrease :)

I've moved the number of times to the front so we preserve the YAY the number is going down but the urge to rtrim the deprecation message is gone.

Shouldn't this go into the `3.3` branch then?
