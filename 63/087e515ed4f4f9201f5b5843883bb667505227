Can you add test covering the bug to prevent regressions ?

No, I can't... This code is a maze...

Well, you said you had a reproducer. Couldn't it be used as a test ?

It's a functional test with master + sub requests + profiler enabled. ie. a heavy stack...

I can confirm that the patch works.

I've added a failing test, which is fixed by this patch
