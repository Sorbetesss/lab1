@unkind Did you find this because your ide reported this? The code might be wrong but removing this entirely is not a good idea imho!

I cannot find any case when interpreter hits this code, feel free to correct me if you think it breaks BC somehow.

After debugging this I think @unkind is right.

3 lines before [`parent::get`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/1c240067f47244071e65af332f4c2364211c7b10/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/ContainerBuilder.php#L469) is called which does the same check: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/1c240067f47244071e65af332f4c2364211c7b10/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Container.php#L295
