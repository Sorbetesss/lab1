The only problem would be: Google Pagespeed and other performances tests/tools rate really bad if you preload a CSS you do not use "quickly"

```
Modern browsers are already pretty good at prioritizing resources, that's why it's important to use preload sparingly and only preload the most critical resources.

But if we KNOW that what we are preloading WILL be `<link rel="stylesheet">` inside the initial HTML, then we would be good, right?

I'll really need to try it "in the wild" (ux.symfony.com ? ðŸ‘¼)  to be 100% sure... but i'd say "yes" :)

And anyone so obsessed with performances still can call manually the stylesheets so i'm not worried :)

high-deps for asset mapper failing because 6.4 hasn't been merged up to 7.0, so FWBundle & AssetMapper tests are using not-yet-up-to-date code.
