I also noticed that and back then we decided to document this small behavior change.

Adding a BC layer on a maintenance branch feels wrong to me, you shouldn't get new deprecation notices in a patch release. The BC break should either be reverted or documented instead.

Reverting would mean breaking BC on 5.0 - Documenting is what this PR is about.
If we missed triggering a deprecation while something has been deprecated, adding this deprecation is a bug fix to me.

Note that I didn't get the patch so I'm just commenting on the process :)

@l-vo What's the status here?

@fabpot from my point of view the fix itself is finished, the blocking point is more a discussion between contributors/core members about what should be done here.
