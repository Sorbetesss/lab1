This should be in the same PR than https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/51426 instead of being a separate PR IMO, as this is about the FrameworkBundle semantic configuration related to the same change.
We don't require each PR to change only one of the packages. It is actually quite the opposite. The main reason to have a mono-repo is to allow to have one change spanning multiple packages.
