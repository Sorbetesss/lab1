I might be wrong, but I think the idea was to only rely on interfaces of the Translator component and not the implementation (in the hope that we would move all interfaces into dedicated libraries).

Well, given that moving interfaces is not planned yet AFAIK, duplicating the implementation (without testing it btw) does not seem a good idea IMO.

@stof ok, fair enough.

I fixed the version to say 2.7 and rebased my branch to fix conflicts

The test failure for component builds is because the MessageSelector is optional in the IdentityTranslator only as of Symfony 2.4. So I have 2 choices here:

- bump the mimimal version of the translation component to 2.4 in the validator component
- instantiate the MessageSelector explicitly.

what do you prefer ?

Bumping to 2.4 looks like a good idea.
