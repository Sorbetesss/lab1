@javiereguiluz , sorry for stealing items from your todo list :)

I do agree with length of `message.translation` and will update this PR. As for `message.domain` - currently it has additional styles like bold and small. I have doubts about visual appearance of this item with one more style applied

Here is the before/after if we add `nowrap` to domain and id but not the message:

It looks better now, right? so maybe we should add the `nowrap` to the translation domain after all.
