Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

As this is a new feature the PR must target the `7.2` branch.

I updated the target branch and the MR description 👌🏻
I'll have to rebase as I created my branch from a 7.1

I rebased my branch on 7.2 but I don't really understand why I see commit from 7.1 🤔

Do you have an idea ?

Executed commands (from the doc):

```
git checkout 7.2
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/7.2
git checkout feat_mailer_infobip_tracking_headers
git rebase 7.2
```

This should be enough:

```shell
git checkout feat_mailer_infobip_tracking_headers
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/7.2
```

I tested but it doesn't fix the issue.. I'll keep searching

`git rebase -i upstream/7.2` with a manual removal of unwanted commits fixed the problem 🎉

I think it was due to the fact I first created my branch from `7.1`, it just doesn't explain why the non interactive rebase didn't worked 🤷🏼

An other question, could it be possible to add this behavior in the next `7.1.x` minor version instead of the `7.2` ?

No, all new features must be done the next version. Maintained versions only receive bug fixes.
