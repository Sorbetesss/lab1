Can this change be automated? If not, then I'm likely :-1:
merging in 5.1 or higher won't reduce merge conflicts - it will increase them actually.

I don't know of any tool providing this as an automation.

What do you exactly mean? Because of merge conflicts I offered to redo all the work on the next branches. I can prepare them already in advance. In a merge you can ignore all conflicts this branch creates. Similar to how fabpot did it with this PR https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/39775#issuecomment-757508718

In the previous PR everyone was generally üëç  for the change. As some time has passed and no one of the team did it I repeated the work (It's not that costly; took around 1,5 hours).

Well, this can probably not be automated, because we cannot forbid using `private static` in the project. We might have valid use cases for it. But this should be a one-time conversion anyway.
Our new code is already using private constant when possible instead of private static arrays.
