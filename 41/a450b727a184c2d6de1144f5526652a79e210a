~This is wrong, hanging is normal behavior, the command waits for EOF, which is CTRL+D. That's exactly the same with any Unix command that reads from stdin.~

The fact it works is relying on a race condition. Don't be fooled.

For 4.4 only, master shouldn't rely on ftell()

Sure, but it's a behavior change which might give false positives in a CI. Take e.g:
```sh
cat unexisting | bin/console lint:yaml
```

On 4.3 the output is an error message and exit code is 1. On 4.4-dev it succeeds with code 0.
