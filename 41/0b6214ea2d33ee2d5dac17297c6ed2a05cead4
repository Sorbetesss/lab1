What should I do about the fabbot failures? They're unrelated to my changes. Submit a separate PR to fix them or ignore them?

They are false positives. We could rewrite the code a bit to prevent fabbot from generating these patches (using concat I guess).

In this PR or another as you wish.

Test failures on php 5.5 have been resolved. Travis is green now.
