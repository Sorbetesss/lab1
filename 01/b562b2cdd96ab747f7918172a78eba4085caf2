We may even want to apply this in older branches

Indeed, I missed that the requirement is only in `require-dev` (in older versions test won't be executed with 3.1). But this should apply cleanly on older branches.

Why backporting to older branches ? Their composer.json make them not compatible with 3.1, so this would always evaluate to false, isn't it?

@nicolas-grekas I do not see what would prevent someone to use the TwigBridge in Symfony 2.3 together with the Yaml component from 3.1. Do I miss something?

Nevermind, I didn't understand you above statement about the req being in `require-dev`, now I do :)
