Please note that we will ask you to squash the git history of the PR before merging, to keep at most one commit per author.

About squashing, if it's easier for you @dbu i don't mind having my name removed from the commit list

i squashed. i don't feel much of an author on those, mostly moved the tests from elsewhere :-D

@dbu Is it still WIP?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by dbu at 2019-04-08T09:12:44Z

yes, still WIP. i want to go over the changes to streamline them a bit, and i want to wait for the bugfixes #30977, #30950 and #30907 landing in master to rebase and solve the conflicts that will happen.

I now consider this ready for final review /cc @joelwurtz @dunglas

the open points can be done in follow-up pull requests and i don't have any more time to start fresh things (but will of course wrap up if you have feedback on this PR so that we can merge it)

what do we need to be able to merge this?
