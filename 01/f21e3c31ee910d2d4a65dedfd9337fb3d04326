This does not solve the BC break entirely. It is now allowing to call methods which require more arguments than provided.
I think the proper logic needs to check the required arguments as well (i.e. at least n arguments, and at most n required arguments)

But the purpose of *isMethodAccessible* is to ensure that the method exists, is public and will accept the number of parameters we will be passing to it right?

yeah, but we will be passing exactly n arguments. If it has more requried arguments than that, calling the method will trigger a fatal error. I don't consider a call triggering a fatal error as an accessible method

OH I SEE!... wait... thanks...

Throwing a "InvalidNumberOfArgumentsException" may be more explanatory I think.

no, because we try different ways to access the property. If we throw an exception, we cannot try next ones

Ok, is it good to go now?

cna you add another test for a method with a requirement argument and an optional argument after that (should still be accepted) and another test for a method with 2 requried arguments (should be rejected) to avoid regressions in the future ?

Is ok now?

looks good to me
