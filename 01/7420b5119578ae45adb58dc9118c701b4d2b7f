If I run my application on a lambda or EC2, there is no authentication configuration required in Symfony.

It will automatically pick up the predefined environment variables. Of course I need to configure the application's role in AWS.

@jderusse Seems like the low-deps job is still failing https://travis-ci.org/github/symfony/symfony/jobs/678251415#L5486, any idea?
Needs another rebase also :)

Rebased. But I think we should wait for AsyncAws version 1.0 before merging.
