Not checked it fully, but i found -+ 34 violations. I.e. i guess there are more occurrences for this specific problem.

Also the root namespace is still missing now.. this annoys editors ;-)

@fabpot can you confirm these are false positives? Makes sense to test the namespaced exception is thrown... rather than some potential subclass.

The FQCN is defined **without** a leading slash. The leading slash mearly indicates to escape to the global namespace. If your IDE doesn't understand that PHPUnit doesn't resolve thing in this way, then it's broken.

Understand.. im fine with both. But lets be consistent :)

Still.. what if PHPunit _fixes_ this, how should it be then? Cause potentially there can be a class `Symfony\Component\Asset\Exception\LogicException` relative to some namespace. And we have to add use statements (with maybe aliases) everywhere. I.e. adding a root namespace would be explicit and less error prone perhaps?

PHPUnit does do anything relative to a namespace. The fact that might be true is irrelevant.

Like i said my only concern is it requires a lot of refactoring whenever PHPunit implements this. Assuming its a valid usecase.. however i guess its not gonna happen because of this.

> whenever PHPunit implements this

I don't think PHPUnit will ever implement this.

@ro0NL check this out: https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/1633
for that, I really don't think PHPUnit will go that way, especially since it's somekinda dropping annotation in favor of `->expectException`

Sorry.. i cant really play with it right now, but to clearify.. this works different then as opposed to `@throws`, `@return` etc.

To sum up..
- FQCN annotations from phpunit should be fully qualified (root namespace is optional, but pragmaticly prefered now for editors and is less error prone whener phpunit alters (IMHO))
- FQCN annotations from phpdoc can be fully qualified (with root namespace) or partial (with use statement)

For both i would like to see a fixer optimizing this to some consistent variant.
