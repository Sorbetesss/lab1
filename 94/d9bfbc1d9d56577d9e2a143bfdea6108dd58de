To be honest, I would expect `1.0` to be shown here:
```html
  <option value="1">Mid</option>
```

@iltar there aren't differences as float numbers in JavaScript, so no matter.

It's a matter of consistency

You are right, but this can't be solved from PHP, because we can't differentiate between `1.0` and `1.00` (as floats) at all, so IMHO the inconsistency is irrelevant in this case.
