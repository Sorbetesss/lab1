Hi everyone! First time symfony contributor here. Itâ€™d be super swell to get this merged in. What do I need to do to get some code review for this?

@nicolas-grekas @fabpot what should I do to expedite the process of merging this in?

We're in feature freeze finalizing version 4.2. we'll start merging new features again in two to three weeks (after/during SymfonyCon Lisbon I'd say.)
Thanks for your patience.

Not a big fan of adding a new flag for that. I think not returning a non-zero exit code was a mistake and should be done without a flag.

Hello @fabpot and @nicolas-grekas!  Apologies for the delay.  Originally I thought it was silly to not return a non-zero exit code by default as well, but then I realized that this command could be used for fallback messages.  Because of this, knowing when to return a non-zero status code could be difficult (e.g. should the command return a non-zero exit code due to missing a localized translation or should it return a successful zero exit code because a fallback could be used instead).

When initially writing the this PR, I pulled inspiration from composer's outdated command and the ability to increase verbosity levels in numerous commands (`-v` vs `-vvv`), but I could definitely be convinced to pivot to an alternative. ðŸ™‚

I still think that this should not be configurable via an option. The return code could be different based on the kind of errors though.

@fabpot I have changed this PR to return a non-zero exit code on failure.  Can you please re-review this?
@nicolas-grekas Given these turn of events, would you still want these `--fail-on-*` options added to this PR?

Thank you both for your feedback ðŸ™‚
