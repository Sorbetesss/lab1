@fabpot fabbot seems to have failed. He wants me to add two spaces after the `|` between json constants.

hmmm, I think fabbot drinks too much French wine :) Can you report the issue on FriendsOfPhp/php-cs-fixer?

`JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES` has been introduced in PHP 5.4, but 2.7 also supports PHP 5.3, so you need to take care of when the constant is not defined.

@fabpot There is already a check for JSON_PRETTY_PRINT which has been introduced in the same time, I guess it's fine to add the two if one of them is defined, isn't it? :)

Sure! See https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/issues/2177
