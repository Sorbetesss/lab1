If we do this, we should do it for the whole codebase. There is no point in making it for some random files (except calling for an undefined amount of follow-ups, which we'd better not.)

@Arman-Hosseini up for screening the whole codebase? We could also improve links to bug reports, e.g. `https://bugs.php.net/78175` instead of `https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78175`

Hi @nicolas-grekas .
I'm ready to do that.
Where to start?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

`grep "https*://" src/` + filter the result :)

@nicolas-grekas .
Do I have to commit all the results on the branch of patch-10?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2019-07-31T19:29:53Z

that would make sense, but do what's easiest for you of course

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Arman-Hosseini at 2019-07-31T19:33:13Z

I carefully review all the results and correct them as needed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Arman-Hosseini maybe you forget to push the result? We see no changes here :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@nicolas-grekas I am involved in a project and will be pushing it soon.

@nicolas-grekas Do the schema links in the xml files also need to be changed?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

No need to patch xsd, this can have unwanted technical consequences.

@nicolas-grekas  Can I change the long links that are redirected?
For example: `http://support.microsoft.com/kb/323308` it's redirected to `https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/323308/internet-explorer-file-downloads-over-ssl-do-not-work-with-the-cache-c`

@nicolas-grekas Can I remove www from a link? Even for a link that is ultimately loaded with a www address?
For example: I use `https://zend.com/` and finally it's redirected to `https://www.zend.com/`

Or even for a subdomain such as `https://en.wikipedia.com/` and finally it's redirected to `https://wikipedia.com/`

@Arman-Hosseini I think using the shortest URL possible is always nice (even if the URL is redirected).
