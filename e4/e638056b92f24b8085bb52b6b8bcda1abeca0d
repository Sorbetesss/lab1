@HeahDude sorry missed your changes in #20490, to me this makes more sense, rather then combining `true` and `throw`.

I agree that it is not really intuitive to throw an exception in case of an invalid definition, but return `true` otherwise.

So.. what about removing the `WorkflowValidator` - https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/20490#discussion_r87690017?

Looks like a premature optimization to me.. and im not even sure validators should resemble a semi same inheritance tree.

edit: affects https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/DependencyInjection/Compiler/ValidateWorkflowsPass.php#L68

Back to 1 workflow validator and 1 state machine validator seems most intuitive to me =/

You should not validate every workflows as a single place workflow, this feels wrong to me.

Not sure i understand.. right now it's optin.
