I'm not sure about it. the message is not a sentence anyway.

What about this message (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/339c0c809953097d5927e7adb30a65219a269b7a/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Exception/BadCredentialsException.php#L27) then? And would it make sense to maybe replace "Bad credentials" with "Invalid credentials."?

We do have dots on all error messages, so I think it makes sense. :+1:
