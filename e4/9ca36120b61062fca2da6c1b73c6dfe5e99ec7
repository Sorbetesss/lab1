Can you mark this method as deprecated in 2.4 (with a removal in 3.0?) And update the UPGRADE-3.0 file accordingly. I don't even know why we added this in the first place as you can easily get the request by type hinting it in any action method. Thanks.

Forgot to add a note in Ugrade file... I'm on it.

Should I squash the three commits?

Thanks! I have fixed the UPGRADE file and the PHPDoc. Commits have been squashed together.
