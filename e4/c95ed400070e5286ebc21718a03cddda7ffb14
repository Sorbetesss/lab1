Changed the scope then, proposing `SymfonyStyle::getErrorIo()` to ease writing to stderr using styles (feature), and secondly made built-in commands using it when it's relevant. Let me know if it should be done in two PRs.

Even adding a new method must be in master, as it is a new feature

@stof It was about proposing the new method here and fixing the existing commands in another PR by creating the instance of `SymfonyStyle` in the commands themselves. see #20632
