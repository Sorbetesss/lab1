Checks failures are unrelated I think.

BTW, is anyone in touch with Loco, because so far they didn't answer to our ping to back the bridge.

(Crowdin and Lokalise did, so you know which bridge you'd better use ;) )

I suggest adding a comment in the code mentioning that the Loco API forbids concurrent requests, to explain why this provider does not take advantage of the request concurrency allowed by http-client (so that it does not get refactored in the opposite way by someone not knowing about this API limitation).

They answered us quite quickly about this issue, I contacted them via their [contact form](https://localise.biz/contact) :shrug:
