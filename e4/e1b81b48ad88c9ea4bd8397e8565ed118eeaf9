I changed my mind about `KernelTestCase::getPhpUnitXmlDir()` and `KernelTestCase::getPhpUnitCliConfigArgument()` and I deprecated it as well (to be removed in 4.0). It's unlikely someone is using it for another reason (if it is, it's probably fragile) and has nothing to do in `KernelTestCase` once the current implementation of `KernelTestCase::getKernelClass()` is removed.

Thanks for all the suggested improvements @xabbuh!
