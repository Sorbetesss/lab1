I don't understand the Psalm failure. The error is `Uncaught Exception: InvalidArgumentException Could not get class storage for sessionhandlerinterface` which according to `--debug-by-line` comes from `/Users/dane.powell/src/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Session/Storage/Handler/MigratingSessionHandler.php`. I don't see how it could be related to this PR.

@fabpot mind reviewing this since you approved the last one?

Thanks for the review, all feedback addressed, this is good to go.

Tests are failing in HEAD, so probably not related to this PR. I think every PR I've opened has had failures of this nature.

Have you thought about using branch protections to prevent PRs / commits with failing tests from being merged?

Is there anything else missing here?
