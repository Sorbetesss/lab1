It is good DX but I dont like the idea that the Translation, Mailer and Notifier component should be ware of all the providers.

We dont do the same thing in the Messenger.

I don't know if it's done elsewhere in the code, but what about to display the URL of the Translation Documentation page where there will be listed all Providers?

Another option would be, that the bridge can provide the package name

That make sense. But how would the exception class know what other class that holds the package name?

Indeed 🧐

👎🏻 It is super misleading if the page only provides the built in providers and you are using a third party one which is not under the Symfony namespace

@fabpot WDYT?

Do I need to change some versions somewhere to make the lowest build pass? 🤔
Only Mailer is failing on lowest

Mailer is failing all the time, not only on lowest.

What do you mean?

I mean that I reproduce the failures locally, same as on [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/github/symfony/symfony/jobs/501911404#L7527) and [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fabpot/symfony/builds/38927626#L735https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fabpot/symfony/builds/38927626#L735).

I added the missing messenger dependency back, but still failing 🤔

The last commit does not help either 😌
