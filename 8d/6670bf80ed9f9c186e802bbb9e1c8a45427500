if this does not require any change in the testsuite, it looks like we are missing some tests...

@stof this is functionally tested only (implicitly), I can add a compiler pass unit-test though.

Added a test and named the compiler pass properly, it was still having "Controller" which is not part of the tag anymore.

üëé I'm all for having shorter names, but they need to be self-descriptive as well. Here, we're not talking about any argument, but only controller arguments.

Other alternatives considered:

* `controller.value_resolver`
* `controller.argument_value_resolver`
* `controller.argument_value`
* `controller.argument_resolver`

If we were to change this, I would vote for `controller.argument_value_resolver`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-04-13T18:34:11Z

@xabbuh That's actually the same length as before:
 - `controller_argument.value_resolver`
 - `controller.argument_value_resolver`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@iltar That's true. But it still conveys the proper meaning while making the namespace more clear imo. To me all other suggestions lose too much information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-04-13T18:48:22Z

That's true, in that case I will also name the class the same as before again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rebased to a clean commit, if everyone agrees on the name, I will update my other PRs

Why do you mock the DI related classes in the test? Imo you should rather use the real classes and check that the definitions are modified as expected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-04-14T12:02:02Z

@xabbuh I can do that, this was simply copied from the other tests

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by iltar at 2016-04-15T07:59:30Z

@xabbuh, no more mocking ;)
