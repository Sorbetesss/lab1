@nicolas-grekas can you do the same for the polyfill mono-repo then ?

On it. Meanwhile I updated the PR for the contracts.

i appreciate the effort to keep symfony/symfony available as a package, but what for exactly?

i assumed git clone+link would be the better practice for dev

In short:

- We can't remove the package, it will break applications on <3.4 beyond fixable
- We can't keep the package, but no longer propagate new tags to Packagist
- There is a big "marketing value" in making releases on the mono repo
- Marking Symfony as abandoned gives the wrong signal, unless you are well into the community and are aware of the Flex initiative

i was thinking `"abandoned": "Use individual symfony/* packages instead"`

then yes, signaling something to all existing installations could create some drama and/or unnessecary work. Perhaps it's not worth it.
