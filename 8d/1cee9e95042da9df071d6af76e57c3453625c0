shouldn't it also be removed from implementations ? Or are the existing resources needing it ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some tests rely on it and I don't know if users do.

It only does not make sense at the *interface* level because different implementations returned different types of values.

When the implementations are kept, the documentation would need to be updated. They use `inheritdoc` at the moment which doesn't work anymore.

Status: Needs Work

Several resources used for tests also implement getResource for no reason anymore.

this branch needs to be rebased too, as it conflicts with the current state

Rebased, cleaned up and fixed.

Why does DirectoryResource not call `realpath` but FileResource does, seems like a bug as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know why `DirectoryResource` does not do that, and I also don't know what users expect from it. What I *do* know is that for `ConfigCache` we don't care :-).
