Having 2 booleans named `horizontal` and `vertical` looks confusing to me.

I agree with you @stof
I was thinking of a parameter like `$orientation`, or `$direction` maybe, that could be `neutral`, `horizontal` or `vertical`. But I didn't like it either

@yoannrenard Can you please rebase again on 6.1?
