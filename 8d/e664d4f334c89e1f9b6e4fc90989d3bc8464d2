Build failure with high-deps expected (will be fixed once merged).

> I think we can trigger the deprecation in GuardAuthenticationProvider and GuardBridgeAuthenticator if we check for $guard instanceof PasswordAuthenticatedInterface && !$user instanceof PasswordAuthenticatedUserInterface

Good idea. Done, thank you.

Note that `UserPasswordHasher` already triggers a deprecation notice when `getPassword()` is defined but the new interface is not implemented (and another for `getSalt()`). GuardAuthenticationProvider uses it for password upgrades, and userland authenticators created via `make:auth` also use it for password verification.
Guard is now well covered I guess :)

Added one compile-time deprecation to ease upgrading. Fixed psalm reports also.
This is ready.
