I just noticed that the build is failing for older PHP versions, please let me check first.

Update: Fixed it. It was because older versions of the phpdocumenter reflection package did not allow/parse spaces in `array<string, string>` The appveyor and travis builds are still red, but those builds are failing because of unrelated tests.

We would consider this as a new feature indeed. Can you rebase and target master please?

How is the status of this merge request, I stumbled over this issue by myself right now?
