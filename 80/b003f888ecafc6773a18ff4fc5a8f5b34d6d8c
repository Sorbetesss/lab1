Do we really deprecate it in 3.4 AND 4.3,4.4?

@OskarStark We deprecate it on master (5.1). We can't deprecate anything on lower versions. What I meant is that I pushed some code here on master that is already on 3.4 (because 3.4 is not yet fully merged into master). This code is unrelated.

Thanks for the clarification 👍
