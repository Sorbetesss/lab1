Looks like failure is related :)

I don't understand the failure of `Symfony\Component\Mime\Tests\MessageTest::testSymfonySerialize`:

> The type of the "disposition" attribute for class "Symfony\Component\Mime\Part\TextPart" must be one of "string" ("null" given).

It is true that `TextPart::setDisposition()` does not accept `null`. But I did not change that. And the property itself was documented as nullable before. ðŸ¤”

Let's revert what does not work to be able to merge this one.

Done. I've reverted all `Part` classes as well as `RawMessage`.
