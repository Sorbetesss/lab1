Awesome! @i3or1s Can you create a pull request or an issue on the docs to reflect this change (which I'm happy to say will simplify the docs nicely)?

Thanks for the nice PR!

Hi @weaverryan @stof @romainneutron could you check out the PR

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shouldn't this also get a changelog entry?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issues have been fixed. This is my first contribution so i am eager to see how it all goes. I apologize if i am breaking some rules on this.
Could you point me to the correct direction (document) on what i should do next, if anything, so that PR is merged.

@i3or1s I think you're done :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by weaverryan at 2014-08-19T20:43:07Z

@i3or1s You're doing great :). You could add a new 2.6.0 CHANGELOG entry to this file: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Bundle/SecurityBundle/CHANGELOG.md

But unless someone sees some other change, we're just waiting for merge (some people are on holiday right now).

Thanks!

@weaverryan Should i change Component CHANGELOG.md since class is added there or Bundle one because it is registered there or maybe both?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2014-08-20T08:30:00Z

You also have to update the version of ``symfony/security`` in the bundle's composer.json file, don't you?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2014-08-20T08:37:15Z

@i3or1s the class is added in the component, so the changelog entry should be added in the component.

And indeed, @xabbuh is right about bumping the SecurityBundle requirement on the component for people installing the subtree repos

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by i3or1s at 2014-08-20T08:52:47Z

@stof @xabbuh Component is in `2.5` is this going to be `2.6` so i can change dependency to `2.6`.
Current one is `"symfony/security": "~2.4"`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2014-08-28T02:41:24Z

@i3or1s Yes, you should change the dep to `symfony/security": "~2.6`
