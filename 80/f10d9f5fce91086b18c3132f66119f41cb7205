The notices are making the build output too large for Travis, breaking the build again

Funny :) I tried with a custom error handler. If that works, I'll enhance the summary of deprecation notices.

On this one, I think the failings tests are for an other PR. But I thought: what about making a new component with this DeprecationErrorHandler and add it as a require-dev dep to all 2.7 components? That would make tests green again for non-Symfony projects that relies on them, but would still report the deprecations as part of the phpunit report.

@nicolas-grekas I would rather test this strategy in Symfony before extracting this handler.

This PR is ready, failures are not related. Patch #13081 is embedded because it's required to silence deprecations triggered when using the `test.client` the service.
