currently, the ProfilerController forces to disable the profiler on its pages. Should we add a configuration setting to allow keeping the profiler enabled in the WebProfilerBundle pages for people working on it ? This may be an idea

> configuration setting to allow keeping the profiler enabled in the WebProfilerBundle

Maybe, but I fear people will just miss the configuration option most of the time and fall in the same trap. Another idea would be to fail hard on any log message triggered above some threshold while rendering a profiler panel. Or something else, like extra special care.
For another PR of course if anyone wants to work on that.

@nicolas-grekas being able to re-enable the profiler while working on it would not solve everything magically, but it would make it easier to solve them when taking care, and with an easy change.

@nicolas-grekas  with this approach can the multiple headers bug target 2.7? - https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/20567#issuecomment-261713472

I don't know. The panel is so different in 2.7 that I'll let you look at it if you'd like... It's up to you, personally I'm fine with 2.7 asis :)

True. However for symfony being a _HTTP_ framework and such.. i find it quite disturbing though :)) and we're still stuck with it for some while. Then again, it's not really security related or so..

I think ideally the bug is fixed separate from this PR, targeting 2.7+. Since this PR only fixes the `profiler_dump` issue on it right?

Ie. we should at least consider 2.8 and/or 3.1 on it right?

This PR applies only on 3.2 yes. The rest is up to you :)
