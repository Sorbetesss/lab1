@javiereguiluz It should be open against 2.7, isn't ?

In the blog post GitHub says that they only look into `master`. If you decide to merge on 2.7 too, the branch can be easily changed while merging. There shouldn't be any conflict.

What about adding label automatically ?

@lyrixx that's only available when using the URL to select the template, but not when using template files, right? Also:

> For example, you must have permission to add a label to an issue to use the labels query parameter.

None of our users have permission to add labels, so this wouldn't work either.

Should be merged on 2.7 as keeping the old files there would be confusing.

Btw, the comment inside the template - what to fill in - is realy cool.

We probably have to update Carson as well, as it is currently based on the info table for issues/PRs.

I've done all the changes asked by Wouter and Maxime (thanks for your comments!) Let's merge this soon so we can test it with real people and that way we can iterate/improve these templates. Thanks!

What about using emoticons like in https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DcTfEcFVwAAHkXX.jpg:large ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ElectricMaxxx at 2018-05-07T18:24:42Z

Ohh noo, even if my opinion does not matter, but i hate emoticons. It is like a flash back in msn/icq time. :-)

@nicolas-grekas to avoid long discussions, what if we merge this as-is? If we see that the templates are too dull, let's add emoticons ... if we add emoticons and we don't like them, let's remove them later. But let's move fast, please üôè. This new gitHub feature is too amazing to not use it right away :) Thanks!

@ElectricMaxxx your opinion, and the opinions of the entire community, is taken into account. The only special thing are the +1/-1 votes when a decision must be made. Then, only the Core Team member votes are counted. But we read all your opinions and comments ... and lots of times you changed our minds!
