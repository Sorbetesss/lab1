It's a BC break because the default value changed. But it's for the own good of the application. It could be a issue on an application which retrieve the cookie value in javascript on purpose.

BTW I don't see how to notify the developper: I'm :-1: for adding a deprecated notice when the parameter is not overrided.

Other question, should I add a tests who asserts defaults values?

@jderusse I wasn't thinking about a deprecation notice. If I understand this change right, any Symfony app that uses JavaScript to read cookies values will stop working. I was wondering if we could say that explicitly somewhere.

@javiereguiluz You're right, thats why it's a BC break.

Adding a deprecated notice when the parameter is not overrided will force everybody to explicitly sets this optional parameter :(

If this should be merged into the `2.8` branch, the upgrade docs for 2.8 must be updated.

I think this change is worth the (minor) BC break it provides pre-3.0.

@javiereguiluz this will only break things if you use Javascript to read the session cookie.

and :+1: for this change. It makes the session cookie safer by default

I set the description in both `UPGRADE-2.8.md` and `UPGRADE-3.0.md`. Is it ok ?

if the change is done in 2.8, there is nothing to add in ``UPGRADE-3.0.md``, as upgrading from 2.8 to 3.0 won't change anything
