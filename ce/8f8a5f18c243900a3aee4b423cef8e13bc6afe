Sounds good to me. @jeremyFreeAgent Can you finish the PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have set `uniqid()` for transports that do not give back an identifier.

Is it still relevant for 5.1?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Still relevant, but not for 5.1, I think we need more time to validate what we want.

@jeremyFreeAgent Can you update this PR with the latest discussion from the comments?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by jeremyFreeAgent at 2020-06-13T09:10:12Z

rebased!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@jeremyFreeAgent Next step would be to fix the tests :)

Sorry I was working on something else at the same time. :trollface:

@jeremyFreeAgent Do you have time to have a look for the failing tests?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by jeremyFreeAgent at 2020-06-23T06:18:24Z

The tests are failing because the bridges require the 5.2 version of notifier which is not yet merged. What is the solution to make them pass?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2020-06-23T06:32:56Z

The deps=low should pass. It looks like you forgot to update the composer.json file for FreeMobile.

OMG thanks @fabpot ♥️
