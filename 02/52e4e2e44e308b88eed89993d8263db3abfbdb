Note the fabbot.io check that fails here is not introduced by this pull request, but I would be happy to add a separate commit for this (one line white space change) if desired.

:+1: looks reasonable to me, it just should be merged into the `2.7` branch

Thanks for the thumbs up @xabbuh.  Sorry about the wrong branch, I wasn't exactly sure how to interpret the [Choose the right Branch](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html#choose-the-right-branch) section of the Contributing guide for something like this.

Should I close and re-open a PR against 2.7, or was that note for the person that would be merging this?

@m14t I guess we can safely apply the changes on the `2.7` branch. :)
