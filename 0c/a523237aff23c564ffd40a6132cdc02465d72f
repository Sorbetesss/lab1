The duration and laziness info feel less readable/structured to me. Looks good apart from that

Okay tried to iterate on my previous idea (code not pushed yet):

Does that look better?

Pushed previously mentioned iteration with small modifications. Updated the PR description accordingly.

Yay :grinning:

By “flag”, do you mean “icon”?
I replaced these by text because I felt the sense of good/bad they carry did not fit with authenticators’ data (e.g. it is not “good” if one is lazy, as it is not “bad” if it isn’t).
