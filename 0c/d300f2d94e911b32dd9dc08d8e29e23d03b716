the failed test for `dep=high` is not related to this PR.

can you squash your commits into one, please

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done.

This would be easier with a true/false provider in my opinion:

```php
public function booleanProvider()
{
    return array(array(true), array(false));
}

/**
 * @dataProvider booleanProvider
 */
public function testSomething($debug)
{
}
```

Then you would just test it with true and with false instead of implementing a foreach in each method.

~~~Yes, have been thinking about this... I found it easier to read this way, but I'll change it if at least one other person asks for it as well ;-).~~~Â 

~~~@aitboudad :-)?~~~

As the `@dataProvider` approach also allows to remove the `deleteTmpDir()` call, it's a good thing(TM).

Thanks @iltar!

@mpdude can you squash your commits :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mpdude at 2015-04-13T09:10:42Z

Squashed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mpdude at 2015-04-14T07:35:58Z

Hm, sounds a bit whacky, doesn't it?

But if you prefer I'll change that.

@mpdude ok keep it as you like it :smile:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@mpdude I think we must apply these changes into `2.6`, can you create a PR for `2.6` in favor of this ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mpdude at 2015-04-21T16:23:11Z

@aitboudad Some of the methods I changed/refactored are not yet available in 2.6. Do we really need to backport this? (Or maybe even move it to 2.8 instead?)

@mpdude keeping the same test structure between branches makes the maintenance much easier for us when merging between branches (avoiding conflicts). So test improvements should be applied to the older versions being meaningful

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aitboudad at 2015-04-21T17:00:30Z

if some change are only relevant for `2.7` you can keep it in this PR, I already do the same thing in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/14341#issuecomment-93702680 ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mpdude at 2015-04-22T06:29:41Z

See #14437. I'll probably need to rebase this one after #14437 is merged and makes it up into 2.7?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aitboudad at 2015-04-24T08:02:01Z

@mpdude you can rebase now

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mpdude at 2015-04-24T13:13:30Z

@aitboudad Thanks for the heads-up

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2015-04-24T19:55:25Z

@mpdude Can you rebase once again (tests have been fixed in #14464)?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mpdude at 2015-04-24T21:24:34Z

@xabbuh Done. (/cc @aitboudad)
