Can you add a testcase or extend an existing one?

From my POV this makes sense.

Let's see what others think before you check the tests. Thanks

@OskarStark I've already extended an [exiting one](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/51800/files#diff-92ed254b959bf4b4dc3efbd3dc399df97dec5bae56631a07d00aafea62d0ebc5R337), not sure what else I can test here, the request is either present or not.
