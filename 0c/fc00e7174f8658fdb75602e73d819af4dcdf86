@javiereguiluz Indeed, my current implementation provides only an unique style. The library which you mentionned allow to apply a different style between outside and inside borders. That doesn't look essential, but I like it. It can be useful for rendering a thinner separateur in the rows. I'm +1.

The new style looks much better than the initial one. Looks great!

(@ro0NL For generating your message review, I hope that you have used:
```php
(new Table(new ConsoleOutput()))->setStyle('box')->setRows([['lookin good']])->render();
```
:smile:)

@stof Do we need more changes with this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree with @Taluu that keeping `get/setCrossingChar` feels weird. We should either rename it to make it clear that it sets the crossing chars for all sides or drop it, deprecation needed in all cases.

@chalasr `get/setGenericCrossingChar()` would make sense?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by chalasr at 2018-01-22T14:33:16Z

`setDefaultCrossingChar()` maybe? Works for me anyways

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by maidmaid at 2018-01-25T11:48:53Z

@chalasr I deprecated `setCrossingChar()` in favor of `setDefaultCrossingChar()`.

@maidmaid im afraid #23582 causes some conflicts.. easy to solve?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by maidmaid at 2018-02-17T07:28:21Z

@ro0NL conflicts fixed :)

Does this PR need some work still? (Travis failure not related)

> including Windows

It's supposed to work with DOS too (cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character#DOS).

> I would switch the default table theme to the new one

Yes! But switching to the new theme breaks some tests and it's more complicated than expected. I suggest to do that in an another PR.
