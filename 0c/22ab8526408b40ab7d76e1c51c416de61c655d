How to set header without prefix?

As it was mentioned in the original issue, `t:version` and `t:text` mean nothing without the `template` header.

Ooops. I forgot those.

Is “template” and “amp-html” the only two ‘non-prefixed’ headers?

I think I’ll make an exception for those two then.

`recipient-variables`, as well.

The current solution requires update every time new headers are added to Mailgun, as the current history of Mailgun tells us that this happens after a while.

It is just a matter of time before the same issue reappears.

Thank you @greedyivan for the review.

I've deprecated passing a header without the "h:" prefix. So we need to "keep up to date" with Mailguns API until Symfony 6.0.
