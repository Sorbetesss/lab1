That's really just a hack to make things work. So, we should probably trigger some error notices when methods from the old class are called. And anyway, calling any of these methods will lead to some fatal errors as the original constructor is not called, so the properties are not initialized.

There are several ways how this could adjusted further:

1. Overwrite the other methods of the old service and trigger deprecation messages
2. Try to return the old service
3. Accept the minor BC break (It looks like it does not affect many at all) and just add that to the upgrade description

3 looks like the better idea.

@fabpot Just updated. I am wondering if I updated that correctly, will the `templating.helper.assets` really be removed in 3.0. It is still in the template_php.xml but the actual helper class is not any more there in the master branch.

I assumed this for now and would update accordingly, the way as it was phrased before recommended anyway the use of the `asset.packages` service.
