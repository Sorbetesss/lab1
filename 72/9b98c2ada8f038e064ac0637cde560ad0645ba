@dunglas can you help review this. I can't quite follow the logic, but it might be late :)

:+1: looks good to me but it's late so I can be wrong :-)

@dunglas can you look at this in more detail? It's a *really* simple patch right now (@aitboudad reworked it), but it won't get merged until/unless we can give it a for-sure ok.
