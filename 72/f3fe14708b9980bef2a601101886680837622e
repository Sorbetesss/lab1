@ThomasLandauer so I assume you render the form manually with the label after the input? Otherwise the whitespace would be before the label and not between label and input.

Looks good. :+1:

No, in my case it is about radio buttons (type 'choice'). As far as I understand, the label rendering mechanism is the same as for text-input's.
