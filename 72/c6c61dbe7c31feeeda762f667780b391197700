Cool, many thanks!
You may have to raise a few lowest versions in composer.json files isn't it?

Afaics, all dependencies are correct. Something seems wrong if we set `type` instead of `entry_type` (`entry_type` will get the normal default value instead of inheriting the one from `type`). I'm not sure why occurs in HHVM and PHP 5.3 and 7...

@WouterJ this is because the type normalizer is broken. It misses the return statement, meaning it always return ``null`` for the option

and the reason why only these jobs are broken is clear:

- 5.4 and 5.5 are not running tests for PRs to make builds faster
- 5.6 is running deps=high, which does not run legacy tests, and the issue is in a legacy test

Thanks @stof for the explanation.

Tests pass now (appveyor failure seems to be unrelated).
