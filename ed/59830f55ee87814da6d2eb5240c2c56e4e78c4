I'm on it. I've also noted that there was a test for TERMINAL_EMULATOR=JetBrains-JediTerm: should I add a test just for Konsole?

And what should I do, just add another commit to the PR or I must close it and do another one with the two commits squashed?

No tests is OK to me, this wouldn't make much sense.
