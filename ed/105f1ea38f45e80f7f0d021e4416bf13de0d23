Added autoconfigured scheduler tests as discussed in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/51525#discussion_r1342467103, but those are failing in the pipeline due to missing cron dev-dependency. Should I just remove cron attributes from DummyTask or how to proceed here @fabpot ?

Locally with `dragonmantank/cron-expression` installed the tests pass just fine.

You can add `dragonmantank/cron-expression` as a `dev` dependency for the bundle and in the main `composer.json` file.
