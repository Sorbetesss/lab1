Improved the metric handling, moving things to the view layer. Totally worth it :) (screenshot updated).

Did some overall improvements to the table structure.. i kinda like it. The whole thing looks really calm now and we save a lot on spacing overall.

Screenshots updated.

Should be reviewed with [`?w=1`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22129/files?w=1)
