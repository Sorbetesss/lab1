@jschaedl Will you have time to finish this PR? Any blockers?

We might need to take into account the new `SentMessage` class (not sure if this is worth it though).

Sorry for the delay. There are no blockers so far, only limited time. But will try to work on this PR at the end of this week.

@jschaedl Do you think you will have something that we can merge before the end of the week (for 5.2)? Even if it's not finished?

Hi @fabpot, yes I think so. I was planning to work on it tmrw again and will let you know how far I've come.
