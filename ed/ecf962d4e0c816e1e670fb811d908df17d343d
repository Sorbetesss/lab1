Hey!

I think @przemyslaw-bogusz has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

As this is a new feature it should target `5.4` branch

Alright, I'll rebase to 5.4!

Added missing tests for `Sequentially` and `AtLeastOneOf` attributes.
Added support for `Collection` as well (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/41994/files#diff-d9f229d35c24533de28e1e630ee4e74afa4ce27d7af8f137d788898e0b9efc73R41).
Added documentation pull-request.

`Required` and `Optional` don't need update. I still added them in AnnotationLeaderTest.

In order to get the PHP 8.0 testsuite green, you need to exclude your new fixtures in `.github/patch-types.php`.
