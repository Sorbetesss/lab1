👍, can you also open a doc PR?

I forgot to add test for invalid cases.

Where should I add it? I see that the `DateTimeNormalizer` is mentioned in the [Normalizers](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/blob/cea26fc72813c826155338f2a82a7e59af558656/components/serializer.rst#normalizers) section.

@teohhanhui I think your addition would fit there quite well (as long as there is no dedicated chapter about all the normalizers we have)

Documentation added.

Test case added for denormalize format mismatch.
