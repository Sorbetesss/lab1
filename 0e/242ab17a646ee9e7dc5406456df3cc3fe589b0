I'm proposing to revert this method because it fits nowhere: we cannot use it in the console recipe because the method is in fwb. Logic fits only inlined in bin/console as in https://github.com/symfony/recipes/pull/491

We are instantiating the FWB `Application` there, not sure to get the issue.
OK for me anyways

The issue is that even if the code is in fwb, it is the console recipe that is going to reference it, because that's where bin/console is.
