To my knowledge, this turns Symfony's YAML parser into the first of all PHP implementations that does not violate the spec on the aspect of duplicate keys.

The PECL YAML extension also fails on that requirement.

FWIW, Python's [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/ticket/128) is struggling with this bug, too.
