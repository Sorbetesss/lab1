The alternative solution would be to conflict with the upcoming minor releases of both package or see if https://github.com/phpDocumentor/ReflectionDocBlock/pull/343#issuecomment-1315059624 can be fixed over there instead.

Fixing that makes sense to me as it is only a test fixture anyway.

However, I think phpDocumentor should still fix this before release their new version (or make it a new major version if they break some supported types)
