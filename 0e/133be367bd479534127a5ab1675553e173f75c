Hey!

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Can you add a test case that this works?

updated the changelog message according to @xabbuh his comment.

BTW: Is it better for you to leave all the commits or squash them regularly and force push this PR?

@scuben Squashing and rebasing is fine, but when can also squash commits while merging as long the PR doesn't have conflicts with the target branch (otherwise it will need to be rebased).
