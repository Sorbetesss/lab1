The test failure on HHVM is because of an incompatibility between PHP and HHVM, which has been reported in https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/5875

Even if hhvm behaves differently, it would be great to have tests be green there also before merging.

@nicolas-grekas what do you suggest ? Just skipping the test on HHVM until the fix the bug ? I don't think we can update the test to work on HHVM (it would not catch all cases anymore, as I specifically chose a case where the DateTimeZone name does not match the ICU id)

@stof I don't have a better idea...

here we go. The test is now skipped on HHVM

Looks like you need to skip the other test also

no, I just need to skip the right one :smile:
