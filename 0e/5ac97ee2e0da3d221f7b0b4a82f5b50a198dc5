Why not something like https://github.com/dunglas/DunglasApiBundle/blob/1.x/Controller/ResourceController.php#L79-L93?

I agree with @stof, `Response` should be a value object. The serializer should not be injected in it. An helper method in the controller like this one API Platform would be better IMO. Btw, we should wait for a decision about #16863 before adding new methods to the controller IMO.

Now I look at it again, I completely agree on the weirdness of inserting the Serializer into the Response.

How about what I have done now? Its very similar to how DunglasApiBundle does it, but keeping the `JsonResponse`.

@dunglas That was a long read! Would certainly wait until a decision is made there. I see some real value in breaking up an every growing Controller class.

@xabbuh does the 'needs work' label still need to be here?

@mcfedr No, you're right.
