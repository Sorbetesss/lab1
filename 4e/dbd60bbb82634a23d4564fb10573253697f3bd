aren't we running our testsuite with the DebugClassLoader enabled ? If no, it means that any deprecation coming from DebugClassLoader would be missed (and DebugClassLoader is the best place to report some of them, which is why we have this logic in it).

Nope, we're not, and there is a good reason to it: we always add runtime deprecation notices. And then, *IF* there is some `Symfony\*` class that must implement/extend some interface/class for BC, then we remove the runtime notice *so that our own code is deprecation free* in the phpunit report. As you can see, making `DebugClassLoader` report these would defeat the whole process.

Updated; needed some tweaks since we trigger the depreciation when the file is loaded.
