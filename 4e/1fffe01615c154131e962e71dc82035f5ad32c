I remember some related issue reported by a user of the Safari browser. Have you tested this change in Chrome, Firefox and Safari? Thanks!

From left to right: Edge, Edge (minimized), Chrome 46, Chrome 46 (minimized), FF41, FF41 (minimized)

So Webkit and Gecko are fine. Let's see or I can make another PR to fix Edge later today

This is how I see the minimized toolbar in Safari:

**Before** (it was slightly wrong)

**After this change** (it's a bit worse)

Didn't have a Safari environment available right now, did hope they'd respect webkit ;) The anchor needs `display: block`, can you pull latest?

No luck with the latest changes. However, if I make this change:

```diff
.sf-minitoolbar {
-    padding: 6px 6px 0;
+    padding: 4px 6px 0;
}
```

The problem is fixed in Safari:

Mmh, that also doesn't really seem squarish, let me get back to you after I've solved this :+1:

@Rvanlaak Any news?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by rvanlaak at 2015-11-18T14:46:03Z

Wasn't able to find a Mac to fix this so far, and the latest Safari for Windows is a bit old for testing right?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@rvanlaak yeah, safari on windows is not relevant

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by rvanlaak at 2015-11-19T09:09:44Z

Updated + rebased, this should do the trick for both Edge and Safari

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@rvanlaak is this related to the issue reported in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/16597 or is it a different topic ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by rvanlaak at 2015-11-19T16:12:28Z

Yes, this fixes #16597 for IE11 and Edge. Also see https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/16377#issuecomment-152121129
