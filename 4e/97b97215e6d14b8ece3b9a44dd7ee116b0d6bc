BC break? Should be in a recipe instead?

OH, it's already in a recipe, and the doc was accurate when starting with the standard edition, isn't it?
Because of the BC break cannot happen as is IMHO.

Standard Edition has always explicitly defined it, see 2.7 @ https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/2.7/app/config/config.yml#L36. So given that all "supported" standard editions and the Flex recipe default it correctly we're only "BC breaking" people that explicitly removed it to fall back to a value that was documented to be identical to the default. Even if somebody actually did that (why?!?) they were expecting it to do this as documented (`%kernel.debug%`), so absolute worst possible BC break that could happen is that we're fixing their dev environment to be a bit stricter.

Imho that's a very hard case to call a "BC break".

Agree with @curry684, this BC break is very weird, however we can do something to solve it, right?

Yes we can: we just need to deprecate not setting the option.

@yceruto Can you please also update the `UPGRADE-4.1.md` and `UPGRADE-5.0.md` files as well as the changelog file of TwigBundle?

Should be ready now.
