Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.x branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Hey!

I did a quick review of this PR, I think most things looks good.

I think @malarzm has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Hello, that's a new feature, it should thus target 5.x.
Also, as @carsonbot wrote already, this misses a test case.
And last but not least, this misses explanations as to why we should add this feature.

@nicolas-grekas it's possible add this feature also in 4.X ?

New features go on 5.x
Only bug fixes go on 4.4
