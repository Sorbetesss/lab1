@aitboudad thank you for fixing this. I noticed that the patch is on the 2.7 branch, but I was actually experiencing the issue on 3.1.6 when submitting the bug.

@msheakoski We always merge bugfixes into the oldest maintained branch and merge everything up to master from there on a regular basis.

@xabbuh Ahh, got it! 👍 I was not familiar with the process.
