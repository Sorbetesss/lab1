Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.2" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.2 <!-- see below -->".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

> I don't have the time for now to check if the command has tests or not

Tests for the commands are here in the `FramewordBundle`:

[TranslationDebugCommandTest](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.2/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Tests/Command/TranslationDebugCommandTest.php)
[TranslationUpdateCommandTest](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.2/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Tests/Command/TranslationUpdateCommandTest.php)

Curious why they did not catch this ðŸ¤”

> The issue is "caused by" https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.3/src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/Extension/TranslationExtension.php#L71

Maybe because they are not run with actual twig templates as fixtures?
