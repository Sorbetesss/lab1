> /cc @wouterj there is a note in src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Authentication/NoopAuthenticationManager.php that some cleanup is needed now, can you please have a look?

That sentence ("Once the authenticator system is no longer experimental, this class can be used to trigger deprecation notices.") can be removed. We decided not to add a deprecation notice there, as it was already covered by other deprecation notices about the old authentication system.
