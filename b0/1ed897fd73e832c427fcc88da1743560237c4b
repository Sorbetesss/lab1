@fabpot Would it make sense to explicitly inject the (default) factory via the DIC in FrameworkBundle, so the factory is there as a service and can be changed easily?

That would be easier than having to change the router/translator service definitions.

@aitboudad I think we all agree that #13986 and this PR and not related. Can you remove your - 1?

Travis failure on PHP 5.5 is due to a [volatile test](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/14078). `dep=high` fails because changes to symfony/config are not yet visible in dev-master.
