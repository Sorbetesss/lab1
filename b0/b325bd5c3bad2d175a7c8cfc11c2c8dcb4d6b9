@lyrixx in which branch should these be applied ? Is it only for master ?

tests in ` src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Tests/DependencyInjection/FrameworkExtensionTest.php` are only into master. So I opened this pr against master, because I did not want to create 2 PR and so make to much noise with this useless PR ;) I just did it because I was frustrated fabbot yield on me in 11961  :p

but fabbot would still yield on next contributors to older branches, which is why we should fix it.

OK ,I split this PR into 2 PR:

* this one against master
* #11964 against 2.4
