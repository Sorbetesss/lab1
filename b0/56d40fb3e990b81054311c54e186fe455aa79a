In case a logger is provided, the number of authenticators is provided in the context array ([GuardAuthenticationListener.php#L69](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Guard/Firewall/GuardAuthenticationListener.php#L69)).
Using `count` on the generator won't provide the right value. I don't think this information is really useful though...

Do you think it'll be worth it to make `RewindableGenerator` implement `\Countable`? (It'll still require an extra check anyway for such cases).

I think it's a good idea to make `RewindableGenerator` implement Countable, since we always have the info, isn't it?

Uses order fixed (must be the last time, moved to a real IDE everywhere)

Same done for authentication providers in last commit https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21450/commits/cd6422ae73848b457b5db31f3759da3c0803976d. This service is injected into all listeners. WDYT? I can do it in another PR if you prefer.
