@Nyholm yes, I will.

One of the links relates to `symfony/mailer`, which doesn't have a dependency on `symfony/deprecation-contracts`.
Should I add it for this component?

Yes please

Sorry for so many force pushes. It was hard to drop "committed by" from commits.

All comments addressed. Thanks for the review.

To be merged into 5.2?

I dont know if this is considered a bugfix or just a minor improvement. Im happy with 5.x and 5.2.
