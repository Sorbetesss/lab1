About the tests, the only error I can see is about the framework bundle, any idea what I can do?

@jakzal I got two other comments notification that you seem to have removed, I assume everything's okay? It was about existing code that I just moved around but still, if we can improve stuff here, I can update the PR. :)

@valeriangalliat yeah, sorry for the noise. I noticed the code was moved and removed those comments.

Final remark: why do we need the `UriElementInterface`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2016-02-03T09:43:31Z

Indeed, I would remove the interface.

@jakzal @fabpot Not sure why I added the interface, I just removed it.

Also updated the PR according to comments. Just the `Constructor.` comment to be removed, but since it's present in files not affected by this PR, I aggree with @stof [that this should be done in another PR](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17585#discussion_r51733371).
