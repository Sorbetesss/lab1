Not a big fan of having HttpPlug code in FWB. It should be in a bridge/bundle, but not in the framework which is only about our code.

I removed the named autowiring aliases because they make no sense actually - nobody should code against HTTPlug anymore.
But since many libs still consume HTTPlug, and since we provide an HttplugClient to ease moving the ecosystem forward, it makes sense to me to have the generic autowiring alias.

I considered moving this to a recipe, but it would need two packages to be applicable (php-http/httplug and symfony/http-client), so that we cannot have one that fits both conditions. Creating a pack would make no sense since the goal of HTTPlug its to fade out now that PSR18 is released.

Moving HttplugClient to the php-http org is possible.
But yet another package :(
While a few lines here make everything so much simpler...
