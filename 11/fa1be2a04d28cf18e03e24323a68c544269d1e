Sure, this is why @stof suggested me [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/50726#issuecomment-1600916901) to fix also failing tests from this PR.

Fixed the failing tests. Xpath translator in itself is not to blame, it is just some wrong assertion or misunderstanding of rules of the selector for some tests.
