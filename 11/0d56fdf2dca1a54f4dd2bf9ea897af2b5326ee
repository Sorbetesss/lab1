Should we add a note in the UPGRADE file ?

@HeahDude I think so.

@xabbuh Thanks for the review. Done. is the "before/after" really needed?

Ok this one might be ready now.

@HeahDude In the 4.0 upgrade file the same services should be listed to, but they should there be mentioned as being removed.

@xabbuh Ok I was not aware of it, thanks!
