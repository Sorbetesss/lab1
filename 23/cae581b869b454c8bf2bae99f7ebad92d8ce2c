@ggottwald Can you update the empty title to something relevant? Thanks.

The changes will fix a warning with HHVM opening an empty directory. Any other ideas resolving this issue? I will also open an issue at HHVM.

@ggottwald could you please add a test case?

Sorry for the late response. Until now I was not able to force a catchable warning in the test.
In production I got a errorhandler catching the warning and throws an exception. I didn't find a way to reproduce this in the unittest.
This fix would also only be a workaround of a HHVM bug. Maybe we wait until it's fixed on their side.
