Why the fabpot.io checker is not passed?
Thanks!

@JellyBellyDev it's a fabbot.io error. It tries to solve common typos ... and it thinks that `possibile` is an English word wrongly spelled ... and suggests to change it to `possible`. The real problem is that fabbot.io doesn't realize that this isn't English, so there's no error. You can ignore it. Thanks!
