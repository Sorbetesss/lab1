This PR is now ready to merge imho.

Based on suggestions from @weaverryan, the SecurityBundle now configures a "default" limiter for login throttling. A user can override this by configuring the `limiter` setting. This required some changes in the RateLimiter configuration - which is probably now a bit easier to understand and less magic than before.
