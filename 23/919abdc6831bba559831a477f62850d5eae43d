This is a BC break, isn't it? As people typehinting for the new interface will have to update their code for Symfony 3.0

Yes, it is a BC, everyone who hast implemented ```ContainerInterface```before, has to add the new method ```initialize()``` to his code

Why not make a separate optional interface?

Last commit resolves merge conflicts due to the recent introduction of `ResettableContainerInterface`.
