Well, forcing to keep the service as public just for the BC layer is bad, as it means that any people using the service in a public way would not be warned about that (and so we cannot make the service private at all in 4.0).

A better solution would be to improve the way the command gets disabled in 3.4.

Thanks for your feedback @stof. So, I moved command in the conditionnally loaded `workflow.xml`.
