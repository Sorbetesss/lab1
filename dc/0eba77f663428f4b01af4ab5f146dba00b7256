@lepiaf thanks for contributing a fix for this super old issue report.

To give some context:

1) Symfony uses `Timezone` sometimes and `TimeZone` others.
2) PHP uses "TimeZone" in its classes: http://php.net/manual/en/class.intltimezone.php
3) In UK English, "timezone" doesn't exist (it's "time zone") but in US English, it's more common to use "timezone", so the camelized version should be "Timezone".

Symfony always favors US English, so this change looks correct to me!
