Tests are actually failing globally in travis on 2.8, this PR is the fix.

Some builds still fail but locally tests are green. Am I missing something ? (sorry for the) ping @nicolas-grekas

@xabbuh forgive me to ask this as I don't understand, what about the failing builds ?

@HeahDude The failing tests on AppVeyor have been fixed in the meantime (you can trigger a rebuild by push a new commit). The `deps=high` tests can fail when some tests depend on changes in a different component made in this PR.

Ok thank you @xabbuh, I was just worried because some tests I fixed here were still failing in some travis build (with php 5.6) while the others were green (green also for my local tests and I am on php 5.6).
