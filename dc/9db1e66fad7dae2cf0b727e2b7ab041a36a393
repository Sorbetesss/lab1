Thanks :)

Note that I started experimenting with autocompletion a while ago. I just pushed my progress thus far today: https://github.com/wouterj/symfony/commit/2bdf79850f0cdf113f8d1c630ee0d149ec096871 (it's really hacky, it should probably use a custom descriptor instead, relying on this new feature). I don't have much priority to finish this feature, so if anyone wants to continue: feel free to do so

This is a little demo for a skeleton app without this fast option:
