Thanks for your review, Nicolas!

As source, I verified that I forgot no rules with this chapter on [NouvelObs](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/regles/grammaire/le-pluriel-des-noms-121.php) and I used a reversed dictionnary to find all nouns finishing with -al.

* Do you want that I add the link to the source as you do it in EnglishInflector?
* Should I use solution1 (private singleton) or solution2 (long declaration for static uninflectedWords) [link to review](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/36929#discussion_r429611157)?

I will update my PR as soon as I have your recommendations.

Hi @nicolas-grekas ,
I fixed what you suggested in your reviews.
There is always a warning from fabbot.io that detects an error on the word: embarras. This is an invariable french word. I shouldn't replace it with embarrassment.
The bugs on Travis are due to other commits on master.
