catching ErrorException is the wrong implementation. Warnings are not turned into exceptions in production

@stof Okay; my apologies. I am not at all familiar with the Symfony code-base, nor the methodologies that it employs. As much as I would love to read-up and offer a more appropriate solution, I simply lack the time. Perhaps you or another contributor is able to discern the problem and fix it correctly.

@nicolas-grekas From what I'm able to determine, PHP's `is_dir()` method triggers the exception. The behavior results from a confirmed bug in PHP (see PR description for link to issue).
