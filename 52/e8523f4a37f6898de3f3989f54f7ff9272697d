Not sure. That's the only one that triggered the Deprecation notice on my test suite, tough

Do you mean I should retarget this PR to the 4.2 branch or do another one for that one?

@brunowowk Yes, we always apply bugfixes to the lowest maintained branch where the bug occurs. From there we regularly merge branches up into all other still maintained branches.
