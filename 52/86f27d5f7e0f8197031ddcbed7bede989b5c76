I was may a little bit to fast with refactor the symfony core tests as that would mean to increase the requirements for `symfony/http-foundation`. So reverting that part.

Still for reference: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/57909/commits/e16fd501da59c21ca23398b86e8cbe5faea0f4af

This looks like a reasonable change to me. Can you also add a changelog entry?

The AppVeyor failing test seems to be unrelated to the change and happens currently als on 7.2 branch: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fabpot/symfony/builds/50310250
