@stof thanks for your review. I've fixed everything.

@javiereguiluz I see that the CSS contains lots of panel-specific styles in this redesign. Should some of them become reusable components instead (in a separate PR), that third-party bundles could use as well in their own panels, or are they really ultra specific to those panels ?

In these last cases I think the design is very specific to those features, so it's not really reusable.
