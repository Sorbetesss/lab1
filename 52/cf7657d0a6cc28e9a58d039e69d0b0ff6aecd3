This will just confuse users with <7.0.8 about why they're not getting important security updates anymore.

@curry684 truth is, serializing is broken with PHP <7.0.8, so everybody should reject these versions. It's only losely related to the linked issue.

I completely agree with the solution and change, just not some of its possible side effects.

If 3.3.6 contains a warning for PHP <7.0.8, and we then remove that in 3.3.7 and 3.4.0 along with the Composer bump the issue is fixed, *and* users that are upgrading Symfony but not PHP have a clear end-of-road warning.

@curry684 see #23705

@symfony/deciders should be merged *after* the release of v3.3.6

Cheers, well solved.
