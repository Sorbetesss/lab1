Travis build failed because of
```
  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires symfony/turbo-sms-notifier, it could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
```

I added a new package to the composer.json https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/41522/files#diff-08024b4d552345610ae41302c94fd454bae1875e86c8eb751409172aa249514cR84 But this package doesn't exist yet.
I don't now how to fix CI correctly. Should I remove this package from composer.json? Or is there some other trick?

I'm not super comfortable with adding a bridge to a service whose documentation is not available in english, that limits the potential adoption quite a lot. (note that we don't have any policy yet, I'm just wondering).

> valid point but IMHO there should be no need for the docs unless it works like expected? WDYT?

If one day the implementation becomes outdated or no longer works as expected for whatever reason, who will be able to fix it?
Not providing an internationalized entry point for a product is either a sign of a lack of resources or it means the product targets a very specific, localized population.
Maybe this should just be released as a community bundle until the service has a universally accessible entry point?
I won't vote against this PR, but I don't feel safe regarding our ability to maintain this transport on the long run.

IIRC we already have some bridges which have the same problem. This should not be an argument, just an info.

My 2cts: Providers (notifier, mailer, translation, ...) MUST be maintained by the community (the developers using them), the core team cannot maintain them except for mass changes (CS, new PHP version, ...).

Agree with @fabpot üëç
