@nicolas-grekas I am scratching my head on all the test fails here, they pass locally under the same PHP versions. Hints welcome :smile:

What's the use case? Can't you use an iterator instead? The downside is that this would be a Symfony specific syntax, whereas I'm aiming at making this function a PSR, so that I'd prefer handling only things that might be accepted by the FIG...

Zero stress, happy to close off.

In that case, doesn't it make this dead code then:
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/e83b82bf946d9080525142dc3dc69b5317b28af9/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Compiler/RegisterServiceSubscribersPass.php#L77-L80

â€¦ as the regex will only allow `?` or a letter.

No worries, I'll rebase and change direction :+1:
