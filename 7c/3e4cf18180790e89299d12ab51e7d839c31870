Tests are globally failing because of a conflict with tests added in #17798 and patch from #17600

:+1:

But some tests still fail, probably because of what @xabbuh explained here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17568#issuecomment-190585004

Yes, I still don't understand the reason, but it makes TwigBridge difficult to debug.

The `deps=low` test should not fail.

Status: Needs work

Ok I keep investigating then.

@xabbuh, It's not the first PR where I notice this, travis builds for php 5.6 and php 7 run the tests without taking into account the PR commits.

I don't see what I can do...
