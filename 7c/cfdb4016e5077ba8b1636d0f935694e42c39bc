We cannot do 2. as it would be a BC break (and would be impossible to make it a soft-migration as there would be no sane way to decide what we should return in this method: the old or new return value)

@stof this is a quote of https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/7737 (it was removed when I submitted my message).

I guess it would be better to continue the conversation in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/7737 if we still don't know which option to choose.

@Ener-Getick Can you fix the tests?

Also, can you update the CHANGELOG/UPGRADE files?

After all I found some time to update this PR.
So the tests pass now and I updated the UPGRADE files.

Looks good

Status: reviewed

(oh, btw, the color of "feature" and "status: reviewed" labels look very ugly next to eachother)
