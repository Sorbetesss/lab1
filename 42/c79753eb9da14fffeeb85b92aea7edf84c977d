@ro0NL is the `Version` field necessary in all these JSON files ? Diffs for upgrades would be much more readable if we were not updating a version in all files, where it is often the only change.

@stof agree and done. We dont use this data, nor is it accessible by users.

and even for contributors, this number is confusing as this version is not the ICU version either
