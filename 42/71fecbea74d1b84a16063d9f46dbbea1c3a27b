I don't know if necessary to create a new PR, but there is the same issue with symfony 4.0 but this time it is the `Role` class

This can probably be merged up until 3.4. For 4.0+, a second PR has to be created to change it into `Role` I believe :+1:

by the way, we merged a similar PR before for the `PreAuthenticatedToken` class

I don't understand why CI was failed ? Anyone can explain to me please ?

Don't worry the CI failures seems not related to the current changes. It will be fixed.
