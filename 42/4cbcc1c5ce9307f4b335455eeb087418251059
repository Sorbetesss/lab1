With these changes, it's not possible at all to set `framework.translator.logging` to `true` with profiler enabled, as it'll behave like if you set `false`, right?
Instead, what about updating the Fwb `Configuration` class only to normalize the value to `false` if no value was set explicitly and the profiler is enabled, `$this->debug` if profiler is disabled?

But IMHO, changing the default value to `false` probably is enough. Anyone can opt-in if they need it for whatever reason. Not sure it would be considered a BC break.

I may have misunderstood what we wanted here, I understood that we wanted to enforce it at `false` whenever the profiler is enabled. I guess we could just change the default value in here and in the recipe and it would be ok.

I don't think it would be considered as BC too.

To clarify: from dev point of view, there is no apparent reason we want the logging + translator panel being enabled at the same time, as the info is redundant.
But that doesn't mean we must enforce the logging to be disabled when the profiler is enabled, as you might have use cases for using the `LoggingTranslator` despite this. For instance by using it to collect missing translations and get a report at the end of the day thanks to a dedicated monolog handler using the `translation` channel. Not quite common surely, but may exist.

The point is that in most case the info is just redundant and disabling this feature when the profiler is enabled (or at all) is a better default.
