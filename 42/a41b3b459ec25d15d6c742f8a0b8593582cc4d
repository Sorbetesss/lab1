What about markdown formatter? should we use htmlspecialchars there?

@ro0NL I'm not sure we should change anything on the Markdown usage for now, I don't see any issue with such arguments.

AFAIK markdown will render it as HTML tags;

```
<argument>       # shown as HTML; thus not visible
`<argument>`     # shown as code
&lt;argument&gt; # shown as text
```

If we already quote using backticks we're good :)

edit: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Tests/Fixtures/command_2.md looks good already, i think we're fine :)

I also think this should be merged as a bugfix in 2.7. @sroze Can you retarget and rebase?

Good point. @chalasr rebased and changed target üëç
