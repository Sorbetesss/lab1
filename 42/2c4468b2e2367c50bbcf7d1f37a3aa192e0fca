Adding the type hints actually breaks the signature of constructor, when "null" is provided.
Since the docblcks are not authoritative, we should accept as bug fix these kind of changes, and we may then deprecate passing `null` in `4.*`. Would be smoother to our user base (similar changes have already been merged.)
