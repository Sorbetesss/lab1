Could you illustrate what this brings to userland with e.g. a screenshot?

Can you add some test?  Also can you double check that there is no existing compiler pass that could be patched instead of adding a new one?

Did not find anything related, which kind of surprised me because what Iâ€™m doing here feels like it could be generic :thinking:

Damn I broke `low-deps` tests. Investigating.

Looks like https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/49021#discussion_r1087838248 was the cause of the failing test, which is weird? How could it register `debug.stopwatch` if `Stopwatch` does not exist :thinking:
