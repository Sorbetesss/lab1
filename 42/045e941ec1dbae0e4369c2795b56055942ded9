for 307, we should have the same request, and for a GET, the 2 calls you mention are indeed exactly the same.

Does a browser forward the query string when following a 307 on a GET request or does it use only the uri passed in the Location header ?

I have updated my patch to never forward the request parameters for GET request, making things consistent between the 2 ways to pass them.
