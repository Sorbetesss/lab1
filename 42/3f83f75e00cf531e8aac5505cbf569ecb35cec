Sorry not able to review in depth right now but I sure hope it won't blow up anything. Then again I think sigchild usage is probably less and less of a problem the more time passes.

I added a special build of php with sigchild enabled on travis so that we can test, verify, prove and enforce that this really works :)
Enabled on the first deps=no line only.

@nicolas-grekas have you tried running tests when forcing the sighchild compat layer to be disabled ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2015-12-09T11:24:10Z

@stof yes. Nothing interesting here: tests either fail because of one of those exceptions about --enable-sigchild, or pass.

@nicolas-grekas but it needs to be done to ensure we don't miss some of the sigchild checks

Sigchild is now tested with and without the enhanced mode.
