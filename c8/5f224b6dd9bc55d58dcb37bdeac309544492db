Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 6.4 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

@OskarStark Tests are added and fix is also contributed to the new Brevo transport.
I can not reproduce this one failing unit test locally, what am I doing wrong and do I have to fix it?

As far as I understand the test, it should not fail after doing changes to brevo or sendinblue.

That's caused by another PR I guess.

@OskarStark I think it is not the same case as nullable transport.

@etlam as I see your PR it is about brevo API, but why do you edit another API? Is it the same company?

@etlam you can ignore the failing test case.

> @OskarStark I think it is not the same case as nullable transport.

Yes, but AFAIR you had a PR regarding null transport, and this PR is failing, can you please have a look? Thanks

> @etlam as I see your PR it is about brevo API, but why do you edit another API? Is it the same company?

Yes it is!

In 2023 Sendinblue changed its name to Brevo.

@OskarStark I am running tests now with https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/51830, and we will see if it helps or not )
