üëç Fixes the issue

However, I am a bit worried about the PR that introduced this - #20677 - specifically that it adds the EncoderFactoryInterface to the constructor. I think we need to be careful to keep commands lazy - I believe this change will cause that service to be instantiated just by running `bin/console` with no arguments.

@weaverryan : Which is something that #22734 would solve. (Anyway for this particular case, `EncoderFactory` is pretty cheap to instantiate)

@ogizanagi Thanks for pointing me to that :). I'd like to see that get done!
