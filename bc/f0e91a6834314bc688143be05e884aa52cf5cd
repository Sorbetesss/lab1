To keep BC, I would keep the `canBeUnset()` call as well.

@fabpot in case someone uses the FrameworkBundle's ``Configuration`` class and check if keys exist ?
Otherwise ``canBeEnabled`` threat ``false`` so it should not change anything to the actual configurations.

@Ener-Getick I know that the BC break would be small, but as it does not cost us anything to not break BC, I prefer to.

@fabpot well having both options wouldn't change the ``Configuration`` output.
(``allowFalse`` is checked after ``equivalentValues``, see [here](https://github.com/symfony/config/blob/master/Definition/BaseNode.php#L254-L261)).
The only thing changing would be that ``ArrayNode::setAllowFalse()`` would be called. Is this what you want ?
