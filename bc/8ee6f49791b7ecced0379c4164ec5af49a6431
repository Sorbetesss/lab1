Isn't it a BC break?

@fabpot I don't think so. Before, when a field had no constraint, the "required" option was set to `true` by default, validating it on the client side (but not server side). I can't think of a situation where this behavior makes sense. Most people probably set "required" to `false` explicitly in such cases.
