Do you mean to target 6.0 or 6.1? 6.1 I guess, since that's not a bugfix, right?

Or 5.4 if it's a bugfix?

I meant to target 6.0 as a _minor_ change. Not really a bug fix or feature but can target 6.1 if desired. If I target 5.4, I'll have to leave the `@required` annotation for ServiceSubscriber trait - with 6.0+, I don't have to.

We'd better merge this on 6.1 IMHO
