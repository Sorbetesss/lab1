I can see two other options:

 * Deprecate `initRuntime` in Twig 2.1 but that means waiting for Twig 3.0 to implement the performance optimization :(

 * Adding a new interface in Twig 1.x for the `initRuntime` method that needs to be implemented to avoid the deprecation notice. We would then deprecate this new interface in Twig 2.1.

I don't know if it's relevant here (I read quickly), but we didn't try to avoid deprecation notices in 2.3.

Totally new implementation where I just implement the new interface from twigphp/twig#1886. Another PR for 2.8 does the other changes (see #16333).

Can we merge here to make Travis builds pass again?

I need to release Twig 1.23 first.
