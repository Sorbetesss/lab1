Do you plan to handle locale and emoji data ? How would the method change ? Should we implement all at once ?

`emojify` should be added in the `UndefinedCallableHandler` i think

Will you make the change in TwigBundle in a following PR or want to release both at same time ?

I now allows all catalog, and let the Emoji transliterator do all the checks.

Maybe a minor doubt about the name... as the slug filter is just "slug" and not "slugify" ... maybe "|`emoji`" ?

Nice "most important PR of the year" ;)
