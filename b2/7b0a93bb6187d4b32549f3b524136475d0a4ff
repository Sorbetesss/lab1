After fixing CS suggestion from fabbot.io I got new error.
Code suggested by fabbot.io:
```php
$instance->setBar(($this->get('foo')->foo().(($this->hasParameter('foo')) ? ($this->getParameter('foo')) : ('default'))));
```

Code generated by PhpDumper:
```php
$instance->setBar(($this->get("foo")->foo() . (($this->hasParameter("foo")) ? ($this->getParameter("foo")) : ("default"))));
```
I renamed 'hasparameter' -> 'hasParameter' and get CS notification from fabbot.io - remove space and change type of quotes.

So PhpDumper generates code which cannot get CS verification by fabbot.io. I see 3 ways:
1) Revert changes related with fabbot.io CS.
2) Fix CS for generating dump.
3) Change fabbot.io

I think first is the best. What do you think the best way solve this problem?

you should ignore CS changes asked by fabbot when they are about fixture files (I thought fabbot was ignoring these files, but it seems it does not)

Thanks, @stof. Reverted CS fixes for fixture files.

@zomberg thanks for these fixes.  I wasn't aware about how many of these errors were on the code!
