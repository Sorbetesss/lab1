I don't understand why the test is failing on PHP7.3 I've tested with PHP7.3 locally, and it works fine. Can it have something to do with `deps=low`?

I don't think the failing build has anything to do with this PR.

@Stadly I see that yo merge a branch here. Can you rebase to get rid of the merge commit?

Haha. I'm messing up everything. I'll try to fix it :)

One last question about this PR: we set the filename as an absolute path. Is it useful? Wouldn't it be "better" to use a relative path? I'm not sure what the spec says about this.

The path used when extracting is the one set as source, so whether it is absolute or relative depends on the user. `extract(__DIR__.'/../src/')` will give absolute paths, while `extract('../src/')` will give relative paths.

Should I add a test using relative paths?
