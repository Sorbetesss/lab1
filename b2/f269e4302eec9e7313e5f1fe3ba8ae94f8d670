I like that this diff is only (+53 -2). I agree that this could be a simple way to control the rendering of the form. It will allow me to render more forms as `{{ form(form) }}`.

On most other places we use the word `priority` where a high priority means that it is handled first. Does it make sense to reuse that terminology?

Nice proposal Yonel ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ‰

I thought about the priority too but the explanation with "weight" and "sink down" is super power. I find myself asking the question quite often: negative or positive priority, but if I think of a weight it makes things much easier and more clear.

I like the wording, plus it's a setting for something "visual", which is not the case for priority ðŸ™‚

Wow! thanks for your fast review :)

I find "the field weight" pretty clear, but I'm open to change it if we all agree with another name.

Yes, "priority" could be another name and it should be interpreted as "the field rendering priority". Let's way for other opinions if it's really clearer than "weight" or for terminology consistency.

We use "priority" more commonly, I think it would be more consistent to use it.

PR updated with `priority` option instead (for consistency).

This is a really great proposal and a non-invasive implementation. Great work! ðŸŽ‰

I had this functionality in an external bundle in use for several years now and the most common use case for me was a `before field X`, `after field Y` (and maybe `first` and `last`).
This covered basically 99% of use cases and shifted the work to the sorter instead of the developer to need to manually come up with proper priority values.

Is that a feature that is possible to add / planned?

That feature is not currently in the pipe and it will not be covered in this PR.
I do see some value in it. I suggest to create a new issue for that.

The bundle @apfelbox is talking about is https://github.com/becklyn/OrderedFormBundle. Yes, I'm biased in this regards since this is our company's bundle, but I still vastly prefer a more explicit and relative API (the one from our bundle) over a `priority` number option.
