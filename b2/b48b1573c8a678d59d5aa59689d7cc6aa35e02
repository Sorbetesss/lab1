Did you make sure that the missing parts just aren't things that were not deprecated in 2.7, but were only deprecated in 2.8?

Should't that be the same? Also, a big missing part was the one about the Form deprecations, that I'm sure are from before 2.8.

Anyway, I'll double check that...

Ok I've rechecked everything.

I've changed the base branch to 2.8, and leaved only the changes that where really missing: the Monolog Bridge
