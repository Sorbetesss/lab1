Hm actually `$guessedAdders` is used in 2.3, but not in 2.7?

Yes because someone changed this behavior in 2.7 (before the optim).

So which branch is this for? I think you should open a PR that can be applied to 2.3 (with or without $guessedAdders).

2.7

But those constants have been added in 2.3

@Tobion Removed the unused variable check has it is not applicable to 2.3 and already fixed in #16698. So must be merged in 2.3 now.
