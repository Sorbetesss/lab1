@Nyholm that form is shared with several css frameworks, this feature is specific for bootstrap 4, should I rly submit PR?

Yes please. Im not really sure what a custom radio is to be honest.

It's just a different CSS applied on a checkbox or a radio in the bootstrap
4 framework. It does a nice box/radio.
