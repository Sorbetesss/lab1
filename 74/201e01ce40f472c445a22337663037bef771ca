Without this change some tests are failing if environment timezone is set to something else than UTC.

Before, `createDateTime()` was always using environment timezone to create a `\DateTime` which is later compared to dates created with explicitly given timezone (testFormatWithConstructorTimezone).

I like this PR since it makes that timezone is set explicitly in each test which better reflects the intent of each case.
