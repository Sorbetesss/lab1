From https://semver.org/#spec-item-7
> Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API

Should we mark the new methods as `@internal` until 5.3?

Oh, thank you. The PR is updated

about the name, what about length() and width()?

On 5.x, I'd be in favor of deprecating the current methods, including strlenWithoutDecoration(), and tell ppl to use removeDecoration instead.

if you agree with this plan, we could skip using strlenWithoutDecoration() in this PR.

WDYT?

If we deprecated `strlen`, then replacement methods should not be internal. right?

They will no longer be internal as soon as they will be publicly introduced in 5.3, at the same time we will deprecate `strlen()` (this is a 5.2 bugfix)
