Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "6.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.4 for features".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

The Twig changes made those last 24h may explain (at least partially) my troubles with the tests
