We could register an error handler, but I'd do this only for deprecated definitions.

restoring the previous error handler properly should fix that issue.

Comments addressed, thanks!
/cc @xabbuh this is heavily inspired from #22274, @nicolas-grekas's comments should be good for it as well (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/22282#discussion_r109901308).
