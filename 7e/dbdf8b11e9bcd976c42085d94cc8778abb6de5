With this change the API becomes implicit and too magical, ðŸ‘Ž from me.

I suggested this change and I think it makes a lot of sense. The current method looks weird to me as it does not render a form ; itâ€™s very confusing.

I see the point, maybe better phpdoc blocks would help describing what these methods do?
