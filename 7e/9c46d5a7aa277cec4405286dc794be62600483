It'd be great adding an integration test case that runs both a compiled container and a ContainerBuilder on this situation. Historically this wasn't supported due to technical reasons. Maybe these limitations have been removed but a test case would ensure that's true, and that it remains so (maybe there's already a test case that covers this already?)
Can you please have a look?

@nicolas-grekas Added the extra tests. Changed the base branch to 6.3 because this is only supported there, not on 5.4.

The failing test is not related to this PR.
