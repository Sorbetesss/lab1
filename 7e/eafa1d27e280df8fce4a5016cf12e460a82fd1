What's about Php dumpers like `Symfony\Component\Intl\Data\Bundle\Writer\PhpBundleWriter`?

They could be updated to use VarExporter. But from another pov, what's the point since all this is going to be autogenerated, and the "vulnerability" targets human reviews?

@jderusse for cases relying on `var_export`, you might request the same from PHP itself.
