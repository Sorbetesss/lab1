I think you did a great job! But now I kind of think this exception class needs a test to test for these different message possibilities!

~~Hi @weaverryan ,
should it be necessary to cover those different messages in a test? Given the fact that it's still the same exception being thrown, only with the message presented differently...~~

given that we have some logic in there, it should be tested IMO, to ensure that the code is not broken
