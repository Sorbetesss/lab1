Same in the root package isn't it?

No. the root package only has it as a require-dev, and this should be removed only after removing the dev requirement in doctrine-bridge (which won't be done in 4.4).

Can't we remove the package from require-dev also? Maybe by bumping the min version of some deps, if they remain compatible with PHP 7.1?

Maybe not on 4.4, but 5.3+? 6.0+?

@nicolas-grekas doing that in 5.x (either 5.3 or 5.4) is indeed the plan (see my comment on the RFC issue)
