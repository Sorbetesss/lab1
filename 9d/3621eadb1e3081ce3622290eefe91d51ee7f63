There is still a desicion to make here to complete this patch:

> https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/28848#issuecomment-429877228 ... (but there should be a way to opt-out of the deprecation to be able to write a BC layer)

> https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/28860#discussion_r225246950 `offsetGet($option/*, bool $triggerDeprecation = true*/)` seems fine? That be the easiest :) It's not needed yet, but surely sooner or later, for lib owners a must (so we should ship it as a feature)

See example in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/28860/files#diff-c6198934d4f35bc102ff362d40b71285R40

WDYT about the @ro0NL's idea? thoughts?

looks like this is the way to go, isn't it?

It should be ready now.
