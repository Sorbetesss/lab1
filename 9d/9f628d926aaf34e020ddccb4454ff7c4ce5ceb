Tests should be happy now. There is one other behavior change that caused the failure: if a class that we try to load extends a non-existent class, then:

* Before, we silently skipped loading that service
* After, we allow the normal, fatal, class not found error

I think this is perfectly in spirit with this change, which is: fail if something is wrong :). If someone comes up with a use-case later to NOT fail, we can update the behavior without any BC issues.
