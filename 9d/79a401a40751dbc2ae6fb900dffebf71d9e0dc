Eventually ready: by running the full test suite in a single phpunit run, we gain ~2 minutes on the HHVM matrix line.

OK for me if it is faster. :+1:

We may be hit by the JIT cost when parallelizing (redoing JIT for the same classes for each component, while doing a single run allows to JIT phpunit classes only once)
