See #24947 and #24946. They've been given a üëç  in issues on top of that.

@sroze yes but I prefer this approach, as it's more conservative: the diff with pre-7.2-concerns is much lighter, thus easier to validate.

@nicolas-grekas I don't mind either tbh so... üëç

I borrowed your test case.
No need for the private method, that's diff boilerplate to me, and will be reduced to one instruction on 3.3.

> will be reduced to one instruction on master.

from `\PHP_VERSION_ID >= 50400 && \PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE === session_status()`
to `\PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE === session_status()`
