@ogizanagi Can you test it before we merge?

@fabpot : Sure, I will.
Maybe @qferr could test it too regarding its own case.

@fabpot : I confirm through my own tests that everything should work as expected. You could have a look at [test_pr_13806](https://github.com/ogizanagi/sf2SE_demos/tree/test_pr_13806) in order to test it easily.
