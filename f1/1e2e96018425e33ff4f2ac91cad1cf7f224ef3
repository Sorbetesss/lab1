Migth be clearer with a simple example: https://gist.github.com/Nicofuma/a7672bf0776efb2eaa5f
the output is:
```
"%%unescape_it%%"
"%unescape_it%"
```

while we are expecting:
```
"%unescape_it%"
"%unescape_it%"
```

Bump, this is a real issue for us as it throws an error to some of our users - because they have a % in their database password - each time they clear the cache.

I've had a few users of phpBB, experiencing the issue with the % character, try the changes in the commit and it resolved the problem for them.
