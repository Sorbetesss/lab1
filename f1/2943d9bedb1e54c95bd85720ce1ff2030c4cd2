There's a coding style violation that wants me to add a trailing comma in the regex array. AFAIK that is only supported on PHP 7.3+, so it'll probably cause CI to fail. Should I still do it?

also, what is your policy with implementing review comments, should I make new commits or squash immediately?

implemented review comments (except for the trailing comma one, see above)

Trailing commas in array constructors are allowed in PHP 7.1 already, no worries.

As you wish, we can squash while merging.

I'm merging it in 6.1 as this is a new feature (this was not supported before).

well, it worked with Swiftmailer, so from the point of view of the user it's still a regression
