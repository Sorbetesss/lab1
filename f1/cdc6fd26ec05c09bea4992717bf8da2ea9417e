@fabpot done, test fails seems unrelated (also appveyor marked as green, but it have failed tests)

Are you expect invalid message like this - "for the "{"base_urls":["\/\/example.com"],"version":1,"version_strategy":"foo","version_format":null,"base_path":""}" package" ?

Packages have names, right?

@fabpot right. But "thenInvalid" function just json encode node.

If you want package name under %s, I can check how it can be done.

If getting the package name is possible, that would be better, if not, just keep it without anything. Having the config in there would look weird.

@fabpot I remove package name, maybe in next PR provide solution. On first look it is not so easy to output there package name.
