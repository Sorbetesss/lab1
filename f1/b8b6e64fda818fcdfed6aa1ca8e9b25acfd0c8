@derrabus would it be sufficient to extend the `isEnabled()` to not only check for `$_SERVER['SYMFONY_DOTENV_VARS']` but also add `class_exists(DotEnv::class)`?

edit: needed some additional changes to `AddConsoleCommandPass` to make `isEnabled` really count ... not really sure about that

We should add a line to FrameworkBundle's ChangeLog:

```md
 * Add DotenvDebugCommand
```

And since your changes to FrameworkBundle rely on the `is_enabled` attribute you've added to the Console component, FrameworkBundle should conflict with

```
"symfony/console": "<5.4",
```

What about moving this command to the Dotenv component (that's what we are doing for component related commands)?

@symfony/mergers Is there anything left to do here? From my POV, this PR is ready to be merged.
