Hey!

Thanks for your PR. You are targeting branch "5.4" but it seems your PR description refers to branch "6.3 for features / 5.4 or 6.2 for bug fixes".
Could you update the PR description or change target branch? This helps core maintainers a lot.

Cheers!

Please rebase on 6.3 branch, we can merge this later in 6.4 once the branch is created. Thanks

Okay will do why can i not target 5.4 as this is still maintained branch? https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/pull_requests.html#choose-the-right-branch or is it because this is seen as new feature?

Exactly, this is a new feature and must target the latest branch 👍
