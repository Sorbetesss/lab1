Thank you for this PR.
By "blank space", I suppose there was a [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) before the first `<`?
This should be merged on branch 2.8, where the files exist also, isn't it?

You are right, it must be a BOM,
I hesitated to merge to 2.8 because I have never seen this error before.

Do I have to create a new pull request ?
