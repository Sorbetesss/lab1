The method name was also wrong. It's okay to change because it's `@internal`.

Even if the method is marked as internal, we won't rename the method in 3.4 as this is not a bug fix. So, the phpdoc can be merged in 3.4, but the rest should be done in master.

These methods have been released for the 1st time 10 days ago, see #29944
I think we can/should change them in 3.4.
