> If you have something else (RGB, HSV, ...), you need to first convert it to a CSS color.

I guess you need to reword your description, to talk about hex colors. CSS colors *do* support RGB and HSL (and more to come)

Anyone willing to test on Windows?

Some tests with the `Color` class + the rainbow script on some windows command lines (I couldn't test the whole repository, as I haven't set-up my windows PC for development at all). As expected, no true color support, but seems like default colors work as expected.
