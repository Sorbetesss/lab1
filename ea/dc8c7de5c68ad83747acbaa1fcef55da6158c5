According to your sample app, there is some issues where some panels are getting smaller width than what they should on hover, making it impossible to read the content (look at the dump panel for instance)

however, allowing icons to go on several lines when there is not enough space on 1 line to display the whole toolbar is a simple way to fix the issue of items disappearing
