@lyrixx Thanks for the quick review! I did check every usage of `PHP_SAPI` and while there are a few others they already have either special support for `phpdbg`, similar check to that or are just about `cli-server` SAPI where `phpdbg` check is not applicable.

I've just unified the code style in all checks.

Important consideration is these would need to be re-checked in 2.8, 3.4, 4.0 etc.
