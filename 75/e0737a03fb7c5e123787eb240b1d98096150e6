Hey!

I think @fancyweb has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Can you please add a test case that covers the new behavior?

Oh, and please have a look at failing test cases.

@nicolas-grekas I am not sure how to fix `7.4, high-deps` tests.
As I understand in this case my changes in `DependencyInjection` used as a dependency for `HttpKernel` tests and those tests falls
So we need to exclude `symfony/dependency-injection: 5.4` for `symfony/http-kernel: 4.4`. Is it possible?

no need to exclude: we should patch 4.4 instead to relax the test case, which is too strict apparently
