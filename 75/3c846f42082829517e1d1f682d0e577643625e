@tijsverkoyen Can you have a look at the broken tests?

@fabpot I will, but I really am struggling. I can't find any references to the old `p`-tag.

If I understand the [output](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/runs/5597950142?check_suite_focus=true#step:8:7521) of the test correctly it should be fixed in `/home/runner/work/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/vendor/symfony/form/Tests/AbstractLayoutTest.php:435`. Which is in the vendor-folder, as it is installed through composer.
It seems like an older version is installed as the file has been fixed: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/45771/files#diff-4125508802c9ee9145cb3e5f9c6742dad7c084623d03442c38b7cba10b8c8f09L435

```1) Symfony\Bridge\Twig\Tests\Extension\FormExtensionDivLayoutTest::testHelp
