Shouldn't we have a separate `TagAwareTraceableAdapter` to decorate tag aware adapters and keep the current one for non tag aware adapters to prevent having an adapter implementing the `TagAwareAdapterInterface` when in doesn't?

`TraceableTagAwareAdapter` added and wired to decorate tag aware adapters
