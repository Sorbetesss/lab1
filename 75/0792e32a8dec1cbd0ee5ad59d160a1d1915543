Why should legacy tests be excluded?

Because on this matrix line, 2.8 is installed with 3.0 deps. Legacy tests are for interfaces that are removed in 3.0.

I think tests should be skipped if they rely on an interface that doesn't exist (because a 3.0 dep is installed). Just not executing all legacy tests will potentially hide alot of problems or wrong dependencies.

We are talking about one line in the matrix, not all of them. All other lines on 2.8 do run legacy tests.
This line is very specific and only for testing 2.8 with 3.0.
