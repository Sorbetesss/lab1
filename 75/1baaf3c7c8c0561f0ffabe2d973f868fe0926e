Hmm not sure why PHP 7.1 and 7.3 fails while 7.2 is green..?

The line running 7.2 tests branch 4.2 with dependencies set to master. It means it doesn't run the Mailer tests in practice here. You should focus on the other lines and make them green. Thanks.

Thank you @nicolas-grekas for pointing it out and please review my new tests carefully.
