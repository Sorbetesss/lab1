The following is taken from the spec regarding `Content-Length`

```
1.Any response message which "MUST NOT" include a message-body (such as the 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD request) is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields, regardless of the entity-header fields present in the message.
```

@stof, thanks for your feedback. I've updated the code-styling to the symfony2 standards.

I think that Content-Length should not be present for theese responses.

@henrikbjorn, that's how I've implemented it.

You wrote earlier, that all content-related headers are ignored on 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD request.

We have `content-length` set for HEAD requests because of RFC2616 14.13 - so what about `content-type` there? Currently a HEAD request returns every header, the GET request would return.
