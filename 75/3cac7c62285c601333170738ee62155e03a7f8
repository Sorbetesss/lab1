Will we sign configuration values from environment variables using `getenv()` or a super-global like `$_SERVER` or `$_ENV`? I think getenv() would be preferred. Also, is the expectation that each configuration file would contain an associative array?

**Edit:** I jumped on this too quick. The updates posted as I was commenting answer my questions.
