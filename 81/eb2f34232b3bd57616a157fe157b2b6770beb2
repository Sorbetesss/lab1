Here is what is needed to replace the bundle by a component and wire it in the framework https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/master...chalasr:webserver-component
I can submit a PR, just tell me.

I'm :-0: on this change, but if others thinks it helps, why not.

But I'm :-1: on making it a component and tying it to the framework bundle is exactly what I wanted to avoid in the first place.

I saw it like "these commands should live without the framework" while it was "the framework should live without these commands", got it.

I think the first sentence stays good as a "bonus" and this change helps at making it true, decoupling the commands from the framework and from the container (right now they can't be used without both).

Regarding my previous [comments](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21039), I'm totaly in favor of this decoupling.

And again: why not a component and his bundle ?

> In that case, the commands are not available unless you have the symfony/process component installed.

Also, as the Bundle "require" process component, I don't see how we cant avoid the autoloading of theses commands right now :)
