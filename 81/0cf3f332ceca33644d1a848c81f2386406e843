Can you add a unit test to avoid regressions ?

I have checked the code, this is what I am guessing.

Finding constraints for a group is MetadataInterface implemented class job. But this is not been used in validatorValue method.

So I guess may be its partially implemented or providing groups option for validatorValue is not there in specification or whenever there is a group option for validateValue method its intended to be added as subPath.

If its in last 2 cases, we can close this. otherwise may be we have to fix that part. While I was fixing another bug, I come across this. So I thought this is a bug and posted here.
