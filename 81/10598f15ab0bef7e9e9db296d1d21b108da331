good catch.

> Im not sure why this as not been added before. When dispatching all other events we use the forth parameter to Event.

Because I only searched for `        $event = new Event($subject, $marking, $transition);
` (`$transition` vs `$initialTransition`) ;)

A unit test sounds necessary here.

For which branch is this?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Nyholm at 2017-07-20T15:49:25Z

This feature was introduced in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21925

I was not sure if my PR is a bugfix or a feature. We may consider it as a bugfix since all other events have the workflow name. We could also consider it as a feature since `announce` event never had the workflow name.

If we think this is a bugfix, then branch 3.3. Sorry for not being clear it the PR description.

:+1:
For me it's 3.4, as it's a new feature. And no-one reported it so...

> a new feature

Then a CHANGELOG entry would be good to advertise it :)

Sorry for the delay. I've updated the change log.

Other events are not tested. I'm fine with this PR.
But if @Nyholm wants to add, I will not say no ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Nyholm at 2017-07-26T12:16:14Z

I've added a small test.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oups, I have changed the "base" of this PR to set 3.4 instead of master.
But it looks like github does not like it. Could you please move all your commit on the 3.4 branch and `push -f` ? If you can't I will do it for you

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Nyholm at 2017-07-26T12:35:41Z

Im traveling atm, I maybe able to do it later tonight. Feel free to do it for me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lyrixx at 2017-07-26T12:43:07Z

The PR is ready. I'm gonna merge it today.

Thanks.

Thank you. I've updated the tests now.
