Rebase needed.
If you want to add notices for deprecated constants in this PR also, here is how:
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/12968#discussion-diff-21823922

(e.g. Symfony\Component\Debug\ErrorHandler::TYPE_DEPRECATION)

This PR has been rebased. Let's see what Travis says now.

Tests are green from `5.3.3` to `5.6` but the matrix still reports failures on components `low` and `high`.

It seems failing tests are due to PHPUnit.

Yeah test suite is finally green! Thanks @nicolas-grekas. Ping @fabpot

Even though tests are passing, this PR is still a WIP as some deprecation messages still need to be normalized.

Good for review!

Green! Good for another pass of review.

The second commit refers to the following discussion: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/12945

@nicolas-grekas thinks of handling deprecation notices for deprecated interfaces at runtime in the `DebugClassLoader` class instead using class reflection.

Failing test is due to https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/649061bd46f541ce8b3ddcba6f5c3b664ecf0d4a

We are almost there. Can you rebase your branch and fix the remaining issues I found @hhamon ?

I tested this PR locally after rebasing it on latest 2.7, tests are green.
There is one minor conflict in `src/Symfony/Component/Validator/Mapping/TraversalStrategy.php` that I resolved like this:
```
     * @deprecated since version 2.5, to be removed in 3.0.
     *             This constant was added for backward compatibility only.
     * @internal
```

:+1: from me. There are places where we'll need to remove/update some deprecation triggers and adding all of them like done here will allow us to see where. I'll enhance the deprecation summary once this gets merged so we can start by the most complaining triggers.
