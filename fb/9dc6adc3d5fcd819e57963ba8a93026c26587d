what is the use case for this ?

For example we want to display a special error page depending on the status of a user. To manage that in the EntryPoint, the exception needs to bubble to the ExceptionListener.

@fabpot anything we need to do before this can be merged?

@lstrojny We are in the stabilisation phase of Symfony 2.5, so I'm not looking at new features at the moment, only bug fixes (master is still 2.5, not 2.6@dev yet).

Alright, added configuration handling and tests for it. Squashed the commits, hope itâ€™s fine for a merge now.

Besides the small comment I've just made, everything else looks good to me.
