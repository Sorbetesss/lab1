Annex question: many ways are currently used to make a PHPDoc code example, namely 4 spaces of indentation, `<code>` tag and markdown syntax. Would it be interesting to standardise that or not at all ?

I would standardize to using 4 space indentation (which is Markdown right?).

Markdown is different from 4 spaces indentation. An example here :

https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6c539e1408769e3de8766d238b11770c95e016a5/src/Symfony/Component/OptionsResolver/OptionsResolver.php#L413-L417

Do I standardize it in this PR ?

That's not Markdown, but something added by Github. Anyway, 4 spaces indentations seems the best to me. If you can do it in this PR, that would be wonderful. I think that we also need to update the docs regarding our CS.

Done : 4 spaces indentation used everywhere now.

Btw, a new php cs fixer rule could be interesting here.

`bug` label looks wrong

@keradus Some of the code examples were like normal text description and it broke the PHPDoc render.

Still, docs only, nothing that is not working for Sf users in their project and now will be fixed for them.
label was automatically assigned only as there was a keyword in PR title ;)

nothing to focus on, just saying
