~shouldn't we also keep fetching them at once for expanded choice fields as well ?~

Forget that. The loop above for expanded fields does not call the choice list in that loop.

Is there a way to write a test ensuring that a submission of a multiple choice type calls `getChoicesForValues` only once during the processing, to prevent similar regressions ?
