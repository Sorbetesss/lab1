@weaverryan i have removed some of the tests because of merging conflicts.. since this is still being changed a lot... after we agree on an implementation it’s easy to fix them.

@weaverryan I just uploaded a working version of your proposal. Feel free to review, before I do the tests. Thanks!

Waiting for Ryan to help me.
He has been reviewing my PR since the beginning.

Let me talk with him, to see what can we do.

Thanks for pinging.

Sure, I've deleted previous comment because I wasn't sure if it's appropriate place to ask :) But I appreciate for answering. For me and I see that not only for me it's really important feature that is missing from core.

@escees no worries. I already talked with @weaverryan to help me during this 2021 to merge this missing feature.

Fingers crossed for this to be completed and merged :)

@weaverryan I have done all changes, including fixing all the tests:
- Most code is from the "legacy" tests. I have added the annotation so we support both ways until the switch (moving from SenderInterface to a ServiceLocator) for the major version.
- There is a psalm error:
```
Run ./vendor/bin/psalm.phar --output-format=github --no-progress
Error: Class or interface Prophecy\Prophecy\ProphecySubjectInterface does not exist
Error: Process completed with exit code 2.
```
which I don't know how to fix, related to that weird extra parameter code in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/38468/files#diff-9213ec846d94497cc34a4b922373cb52e0d53015604427a4aec0661289c58ac8R177

- Feel free to test! Now it's ready!

Pending to fix the console command tests after adding the list of transports and the warning.

Thanks @chalasr. Already fixed with your suggestions.
