For master, that's not a bug but an improvement.

True, and i dont mind really. Just picked 3.3 so profiler templates stay in sync as much as possible. But im not sure that's a goal we should keep pursuing.

And of course, curious what others think of the change / branch target.

2nd commit is for 3.3; ill create a new PR if needed.
