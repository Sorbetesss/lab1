For the record, `$class`/`$type` can be other kind of types, including interfaces: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/src/Symfony/Component/Serializer/Normalizer/DateTimeNormalizer.php#L31

However, as even interfaces define the constant `::class` in PHP, using `$class` looks good enough for me.

@dunglas We can also change `$class` to `$type` everywhere. My concern was just to sync the parameters. In case of the `ArrayDenoramalizer` we accept `SomeClass[]`, so `$type` might be more accurate.

Indeed, maybe should we use `$type` everywhere then.

Done.
