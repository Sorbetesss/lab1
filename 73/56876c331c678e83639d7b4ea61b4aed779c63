Is there a reason not to use the common polyfill? That would catch more edge cases

I have no idea, why we're using plain JS here. I guess jQuery isn't used to prevent any conflicts with jQuery used from website slice up on which profiler is included.

Some of polyfills, but I don't think that we need one yet:

All done, but polyfill, which is a bit unclear. I must remind, that I haven't tested this anywhere, so if you can please test in IE and any other browser.
