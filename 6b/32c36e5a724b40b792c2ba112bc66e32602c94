The main differences with the original PR are:

* I have removed the code that checks is stopwatch is available as the check is already done during compilation
* I have removed the check for names that was already used as it is not needed (the stopwatch knows how to deal with such cases).

I've made further modifications:

 * The stopwatch name can now be any valid expression (more consistent with the other Twig built-in tags)
 * I've removed the possibility to add the name after endstopwatch (because of the previous change and also for more consistency)
