Is there any reason why a `span` is used to display the alerts? When I look at the docs of bootstrap, I can clearly see that the `div` tag are used for that.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/

Using `d-block` is for me really odd.

Yes, it was changed in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/5dcaaadb5e8c01148b67d009c95a5118849f9a55 to "Make sure form errors is valid HTML".
Seems unnecessary to me too.

The reason for this is that now error blocks might appear inside `<label>` tags. You cannot have `<div>` inside a label.
