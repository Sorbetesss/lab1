Shouldn't we contribute that change upstream? Because it will be lost next time we sync with the Apache list.

I agree, @ifaridjalilov here are the two files we use as a source
https://github.com/minad/mimemagic/blob/master/script/freedesktop.org.xml
and
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types
Could you submit this update there please?

@fabpot I just ran the `update_mime_types.php` and the additions were not removed, so this is safe.
