@xabbuh please review #38217 first, blocks this one.

and I'm unsure about the base branch to patch against. 3.4 from the list / docs, but the PR template says the lowest branch I ran over the bug. For me that is 2.6 where I ran over it. Just let me know if the change should merged into any lower than the 3.4 branch.
