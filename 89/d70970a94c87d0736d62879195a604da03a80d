Hey!

I had a quick look at this PR, I think it is alright.

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

Friendly ping @Nyholm, how to proceed here?

I don't sure, I can help in this days, as too much busy with learning.
But I hope, after Feb Q2 maybe will have a enough energy to help community.

Who can assist me, which translations are not translated? And in which branch of Symfony we need to work.

I think we covered all translations here.

I suggest merging this PR in its current state.
