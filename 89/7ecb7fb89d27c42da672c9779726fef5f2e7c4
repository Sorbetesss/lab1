Can you revert the second commit? We use the backslash only for a limited set of functions that are known to be optimised in this case.

@xabbuh Fixed

Also, I replace \array_splice (which shouldn't have the \ if I understood correctly?) with \array_slice (which does?), because it seems to be ~1.5x faster in this case

As this is a bug fix, it should target 3.4 instead of master.

Indeed, fixed! (I hope, sorry, only my 2nd little PR on this project)
