Btw, I don't agree with the channel in `setLogger(LoggerInterface $logger, $channel = 'deprecation')`. The separation into channels is random and does not belong into the ErrorHandler.
If a logger wants to treat different types differently, it's the task of the logger to distinguish messages by log level or `type` context parameter.

@Tobion I agree, I'll work on that for 2.6
