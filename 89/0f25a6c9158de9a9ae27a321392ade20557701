@nicolas-grekas : I've reverted last changes about the protected properties. I don't have strong justification appart simplification (and STA). Argument about maintenance burden is fair, but `AbstractServiceConfigurator` already opens these properties (`AbstractServiceConfigurator::$defaultTags` as protected doesn't seem legit AFAIU btw).

Before inspecting this more and doing any other change:
How likely are these configurator classes to be extended in userland? Is that something we really want? What about making them `@final` or even `@internal`, appart from the `AbstractConfigurator`?
