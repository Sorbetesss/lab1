I voted too quickly, removing it for now. When this code path is taken, it means one is using a deprecated service factories configuration. Why should we hide the notice? To me, there is something to upgrade, thus to warn about. Did I miss something?

@nicolas-grekas but you already got the notice in the place using it. This will trigger a second notice in a place out of the control of the user

btw, the call to ``setFactoryClass`` will also trigger a deprecation warning here, so you would even get 2 new warnings
