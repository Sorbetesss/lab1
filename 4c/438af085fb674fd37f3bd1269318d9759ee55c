Hey!

I think @tienvx has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

üëç on rate limiting for messenger transports üôÇ

When using the Messenger component in order to asynchronously send emails via the Mailer component being able to limit the total amount of emails per time unit would be really helpful in hosting environments that impose a limit on how many emails you can send via their SMTP per hour or day for instance.

I just rebased the changed on the latest 6.1 branch, but I'm really looking for some input on whether these changes are actually going in the right direction (and will be accepted) before I will be spending some time on tests.

@nicolas-grekas Requested adjustments have been made, and I added two tests.

(the failed checks do not seem to be related to this change)
