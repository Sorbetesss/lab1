Tests for the low requirements must be fixed.

Oh sorry, missed that test failure. For your information, this means that you should add a dev dependency on `symfony/translation` in the Http and Core security `composer.json` files.

Thanks for the tip @wouterj.

I understand why to add it to the Http Security but why should i added it also to Core Security? I didn't changed anything in this "area".

My mistake (in my mind, all authentication listeners lived in Core, but most of them actually live in Http).

:+1: the remaining test failure is not caused by this PR
