If any, could you please describe risks or security implications that might result from the ability to set the ACL directly from the command line?

@ErichHartmann I think there is no specific security risk or implication for this command. If an attacker get a shell on your server, it's over. Even without this command.

He can access to database's credentials through `app/config/parameters.yml`, run any SQL query (including an ACL related one) with `doctrine:query:sql`, run arbitrary PHP code with `php -a` and do even worse with the shell itself (`rm -Rf /`).

Is this PR ready to be merged? Can I start working on the PR in the doc?

@dunglas There is no need to document the command in the docs, but the help message should be expanded instead.

the ``isEnabled`` method should be overwritten so that the command is available only when the ACL system is enabled. See the ``router:debug`` command for an example of usage

@fabpot @stof thanks for the review. I'll be very busy next week but I'll make needed changes when I'll be back.

@fabpot @stof Fixed reported issues and added the ability to use `/` as a namespace delimiter. Added a more precise (but still rude) help message.

Fixed options types.

@fabpot use arguments when required. Simplified and enhanced CLI.

Looks good to me for 2.6. Thanks.
