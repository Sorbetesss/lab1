I don't agree.

> and try to avoid it as much as possible to smoothen the transition to 3.0

What? Then we don't need to releae 3.0 at all and just call it 2.8.

> 2.7 is going to be mostly compatible with 3.0. Lets continuously test this assumption and see when and were we break compat with 2.7

This assumes we have full test coverage which is obviously not true. So why test 2.7 with 3.0 in the first place?

Of course we do: otherwise we won't be able to remove deprecated interfaces.

It just account for what we have. It's better than being blind.

Why `~3.0.0` and not `~3.0`? If 3.0 is compatible with 2.7, then 3.1 as well according to our semantic versioning.

@Tobion I chose `~3.0.0` to open the transition to 3.0, but shorten 2.7 lifetime.
