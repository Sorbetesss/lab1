Ldap Component
==============

A Ldap client for PHP on top of PHP's ldap extension.

Disclaimer
----------

This component is only stable since Symphony 3.1. Earlier versions 
have been marked as internal as they still needed some work.
Breaking changes were introduced in Symphony 3.1, so code relying on
previous version of the component will break with this version.
