WebLink Component
=================

The WebLink component manages links between resources. It is particularly useful to advise clients
to preload and prefetch documents through HTTP and HTTP/2 pushes.

This component implements the [HTML5's Links](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html), [Preload](https://www.w3.org/TR/preload/)
and [Resource Hints](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/) W3C's specifications.
It can also be used with extensions defined in the [HTML5 link type extensions wiki](http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values#HTML5_link_type_extensions).
