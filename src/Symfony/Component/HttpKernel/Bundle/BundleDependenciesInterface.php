 * Class BundleDependenciesInterface.
 *
 * Adds capability to let Bundles specify other bundles they need to load (before this one).
 *
 * This allows you to define only the bundle you want to use in registerBundles(), but don't need to take care about
 * registering the dependencies it uses, and you won't need to make any changes in your kernel if those dependencies
 * changes.
 *
 * In this interface bundle dependencies are returned as FQN strings because several bundles (and root) might register
 * the same bundle. This means dependencies can not have dependencies in its constructor, reflecting best practice in
 * Symfony of not having any logic in Bundle constructors given it is executed on every Kernel boot.
