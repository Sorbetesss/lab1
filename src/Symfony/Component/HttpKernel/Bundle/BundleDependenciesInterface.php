/**
 * Class BundleDependenciesInterface.
 *
 * Adds capability to let Bundles specify other bundles they need to load (before this one), both required and optional
 * dependencies.
 *
 * This allows you to define only the bundle you want to use in registerBundles(), but don't need to take care about
 * registering the dependencies it uses, and you won't need to make any changes in your kernel if those dependencies
 * change.
 *
 * NOTE: In this interface bundle dependencies are returned as FQN strings because several bundles (and root) might
 * register the same bundle. This means dependencies can not have arguments in its constructor, reflecting best practice
 * in Symfony of not having any logic in Bundle constructors given it is executed on every Kernel boot.
 *
 * NOTE2: This functionality is not a bundle plugin system, but rather a way to set your upstream dependencies,
 *        or in the case of a distribution bundle, all bundles they are to be used with.
