Mercure Component
=================

> Mercure is a protocol allowing to push data updates to web browsers and other
  HTTP clients in a convenient, fast, reliable and battery-efficient way.
  It is especially useful to publish real-time updates of resources served through
  web APIs, to reactive web and mobile apps.

The Mercure Component implements the "publisher" part of [the Mercure Protocol](https://mercure.rocks).
