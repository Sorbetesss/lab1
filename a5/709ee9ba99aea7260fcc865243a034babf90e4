Maybe throw exception for `lazy: false` then?

I'm going to do this good idea. I'm also wondering about allowing lazy: Some\Interface at the loader level. Would be equivalent to lazy: true + adding the tag. WDYT?

Not needed actually, and won't be fixed in ProxyManager v2.1 which is in security-only fixes mode, but is the version compatible with PHP 7.1, thus Symfony 4.

This PR deals with the issue on its own. Ready.

Status: needs review

Do we still need LazyLoadingValueHolderFactoryV1 in master ?
