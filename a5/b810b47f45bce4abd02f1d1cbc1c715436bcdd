Usually projects using the component don't need to provide own implementations of that interface. This is why I was so curious about your use-case.

`expected-missing-return-types.diff` needs to be changed, see hints in the file

This is true.

For the record, my use-case is a decorator object that implements `InputInterface`, `OutputInterface` and `StyleInterface` to improve DX.

I'm having some trouble updating `expected-missing-return-types.diff`. When I run the commands, it changes dozens of files and overrides a ton of lines in `expected-missing-return-types.diff`.

I _think_ I finagled it to work correctly - CI's happy at least :)

I believe `.editorconfig` caused extra line trims. Not sure if that's a problem or not...
