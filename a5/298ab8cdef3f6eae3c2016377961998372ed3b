xlf is the file extension, xliff is the format. just as you have yml for YAML files.
So not sure if this is a good change.

And this is BC (even it it fixes a bug), you can no longer use xliff as format, so you need to support both xliff and xlf.

@sstok Maybe my description wasn't clear enough. You can not use `xliff` as a value for the `output-format` argument now. Thats the reason for this PR.

```
$ app/console translation:update --output-format xliff en --dump-messages
Wrong output format
Supported formats are php, xlf, po, mo, yml, ts, csv, ini, json, res.
```

The translation *loader* still supports both 'xliff' and 'xlf' extension and type, but the *dumper* can dump `.xlf` files only and is registered for the `xlf` type only. So you have to use `xlf` not only as `extension` but also as the name of the `format`. The same is true for YAML, where the name of the format you have to use is `yml`, like the extension.
