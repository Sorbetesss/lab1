Perhaps it would be useful to also support regular expressions. Your opinion?
Can be done in another PR.

@shouze - actually I start to think that it would be nice to use validation constraints with it. This would couple the two components though. As for regexp - you can use a callback, I don't see much of a gain in direct support.

@marekkalnik you're right.

In fact we've seen your PR few days ago while we were looking for an elegant solution to validate query string params for a REST api (and avoid some cache poisoning).

We know that we could use Form validation but it looked a bit over bloated for a such simple thing.
We finally adopted a solution based on the treeBuilder because OptionResolver does not support nested options https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/4833

BTW OptionsResolver must remain simple.

Great feature ! :+1:

Regex and constraints should be possible with the closure, so adding that would over-complicate things.

Ok, I'll write some by the end of the week.

I added the doc, sory that it's late, it wasn't easy with all the family holidays :(

But it made me think - it won't work with the addAllowedValue, so maybe I should write a separate method for specyfying a callback? What do you think?

@marekkalnik Can you fix the CS issues (http://fabbot.io/report/symfony/symfony/8375/8d05642f9a57150f51da56a3a3c7a122375b71ba)?

@fabpot I fixed the CS error and changed the message
