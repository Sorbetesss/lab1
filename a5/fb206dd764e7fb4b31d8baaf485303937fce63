Why not `7.3`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The question is more: why 7.3?
7.2 is better for adoption.

~Typed private properties would be a good driver for 7.3 I think?~

edit: d'oh that's 7.4

@ciaranmcnulty don't you talk about 7.4? See https://www.php.net/releases/7_3_0.php

I'd be in favor of PHP 7.3 too as 7.2 active support ends on November, 30 2019, so at the same time Symfony 5.0 will be released.

Since 7.4 will happen at the same time as sf5, it is probably too early to make that a minimal?

7.2 is all we need to start working on Symfony 5.0.

@nicolas-grekas you are of course right. I forgot 7.3 had so few compelling features (some nice stuff but nothing that would require it over 7.2)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by vudaltsov at 2019-05-28T13:52:55Z

Okay, I agree that as a **minimum** version `7.2` is good.

I'm for 7.2 too. 7.3 does not bring so much nice features. 7.2 seems better for adoption.

üëç 7.2 for now. Ref. #24283
Maybe bump to 7.4 later if released in time. Then we would use the latest PHP version like done with SF 4.
