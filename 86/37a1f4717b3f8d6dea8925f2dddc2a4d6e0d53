Just tested with the steps described here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/11474#issuecomment-50237986 and I confirm that this fixes the issue.

Note to myself: this should be merged in 2.5.

@zulus Can you add a unit test to ensure that we don't have a regression in the future? Thanks.

@fabpot  Off course. I also can close this pull request and prepare for 2.5 with tests.

I think I have a similar issue with Symfony 2.6.1. I created a form (which works perfectly) but when I call the profiler I get:

Key "type" for array with keys "id, name, view_vars, children" does not exist in @WebProfiler/Collector/form.html.twig at line 423

Will the fix also be merged in 2.6.1?

The only thing I don't have the allow_add enabled :/
