Hi @wouterj, that is a good point.

@weaverryan and I picked `kernel.event_dispatcher` for the consistency with other tags. My other ideas were `event.dispatcher` or `event_dispatcher`, but those seem a bit short and out of place.

`kernel.dispatcher` won't do due to the message bus also dispatching.

I'm a bit out of ideas on this one.

Would it make sense to enable auto-configuration for the new tag?

It is. See https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/39276/files#diff-e4f52d5033296421d02e360c8355aa1931bdfb0c12579f4815ea02b724322c0cR483

I'm also a bit of out of ideas. Maybe `event_dispatcher.dispatcher`? (to match the `<component name>.<subject>` convention)

That sound good to me. I'll make the change.
