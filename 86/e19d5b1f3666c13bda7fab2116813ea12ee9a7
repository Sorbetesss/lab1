Could you ensure all missing PHPDoc are not missing Anymore.

But please, add PHPDoc only when it is useful for the reader or the IDE.

So for example, the one you added is useful. but the following is useless:
```php

    /**
     * Set the title.
     *
     * @param string $title A title
     */
    public function setTitle($title)
    {
        $this->title = $title;
    }
```
