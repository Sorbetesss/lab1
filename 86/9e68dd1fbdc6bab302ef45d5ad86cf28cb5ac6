I think we should also trigger this event when CommandNotFound exceptions are thrown. What about allowing `null` for the `command` in `ConsoleErrorEvent`?

+1 for having the event fired on command not found. As there is currently no working case where the command is null I think it's safe to make it nullable in this specific event.
