Can you please target 4.4 instead?

Could we use this tool's error output code for the CI job?

@fabpot did remove the changelog entry, @nicolas-grekas did target branch 4.4 instead üëç

Thanks.
Can you add a step in the CI that would run this command to warn us when there is a mistake?

Done in c2aa16e

The script now runs in verbose mode, so translation mismatches get visible. Output looks great on CI: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/42201/checks?check_run_id=3122692589

Please note; missing translations will not be taken into account for the script's exit code

@fabpot @nicolas-grekas ready for review again

Based on the suggestion of @OskarStark fb731ac7c6a8b8cba97a4d95747ab0578e1bfa23 was committed. The CI step now runs as part of the existing integration workflow, and only runs when translation files were changes.

This now also means that CI is green entirely, as this PR does not change any translation files. Would be good to create a reminder of still having to fix those translation IDs.

Ready for review again @nicolas-grekas @fabpot
