@sroze I've just taken out my autoconfiguration removal - so this PR is now dead-simple :)

@weaverryan I've updated the tests within your PR as well.

Though, it breaks the tests with a service that has a dependency on the `logger` service. The service is removed via the `MessengerPass`. Maybe the best idea is to make the `logger` dependency lazy with `on-invalid="null"` on this given service?
