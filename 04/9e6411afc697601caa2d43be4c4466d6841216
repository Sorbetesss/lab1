Hey!

I think @fancyweb has recently worked with this code. Maybe they can help review this?

Cheers!

Hi @fabpot,
The error from *fabbot.io* is a false positive, so I'm wondering if the code of this bot is open in order to fix it.
Or maybe it relies on open tools?

Thank you for your PR, @villfa. The open source tool that fabbot relies on is PHP CS Fixer. Since the failure is a false positive as you already discovered, you can simply ignore it. ðŸ™‚
