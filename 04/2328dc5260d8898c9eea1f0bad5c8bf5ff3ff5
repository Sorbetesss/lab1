The conflict rule is not needed (at least for the tests to pass), dev-dependencies are installed for testing the FrameworkBundle, and the min version already is set to `^3.4`.
I think the issue comes from the fact packagist is only seeing 0898e9f01e1dedc70fb4f77b594227619d7e1711 [as last commit on `symfony/form:master`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/form#dev-master), hence the command is not available yet.
But 3.4 has properly been merged on master though: https://github.com/symfony/form/commits/master

@nicolas-grekas nice catch. I'll look at master tomorrow if @yceruto can't before

Re-opening this one, as the conflict rule looks legit to me though: We don't do a `class_exists` check on `DebugCommand` which is only available as of `symfony/form` 3.4. So Using FrameworkBundle 3.4+ with `symfony/form` 3.3 will raise a:

> PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\ClassNotFoundException: Attempted to load class "DebugCommand" from namespace "Symfony\Component\Form\Command".

We could tweak the FrameworkExtension, but I think we're already used to bump the min-version by adding a conflict rule in such cases in the FrameworkBundle.

Agree (my own PR but it was not intended for that).
