I would do that in master as there is no bug fix here.

@fabpot Fine for me. Can you do this when merging, or do you need a new PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by fabpot at 2017-03-23T16:58:14Z

You can change the target branch on the PR directly.

Must be a new GH feature or it has always been so well hidden I missed it.

Changed.

If you could also change the target to 3.4, that would be wonderful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fabpot changed base to 3.4 ‚Äì did I get you right?

Also, at least in the web interface, GitHub shows no merge conflicts...?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4 üëç
Can you still rebase please? We don't merge PRs with merge commits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mpdude at 2017-06-16T19:09:17Z

Hm, rebasing and fixing up a branch that I had previously rebased in the GH web interface, including merge conflicts, really challenged my git skills... hope it's allright now.

Apparently, tests are broken on deps low.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mpdude at 2017-06-16T21:05:47Z

Messed up the test during merge conflict resolution, should be fixed now.
