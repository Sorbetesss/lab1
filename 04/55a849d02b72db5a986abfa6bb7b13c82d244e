What about `WhenNot`? would that help with DX + IDE autocompletion?

I was not sure at first it makes sense in English but thinking about it again, seems fine when writing it. This is way better for discovery indeed:

Note that the `Choice` validator was inverted not by adding `NotChoice` (suggested in #26074) but by adding `match=false` to the original validator in #45977.

It might make sense to streamline here?

I kind of find it hard to understand at first glance personally. I'm afraid it gives "yoga style" kind of confusion when reading it.
But I'd understand if we want to keep some consistency (I'm not sure I fully read the discussion about Choice), just my thought üôÇ

What's the status of this PR?

Status: Needs Review

I still think that would be a nice addition for DX üëç
