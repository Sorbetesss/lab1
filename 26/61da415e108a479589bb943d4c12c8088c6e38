Update: Use `AuthenticationException`. Add `@expectedExceptionMessage`.

@glye if you want to have the PR appearing as merged rather than closed, I suggest you to squash your fixup commit yourselves.
Otherwise, we will squash it at the time of merging the PR, but Github will then not recognize it as a merged PR (we are not using the Github UI to squash the commits, but the git CLI)

Right! Squashed.
