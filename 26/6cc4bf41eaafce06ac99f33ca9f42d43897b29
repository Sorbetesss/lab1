Thanks @nicolas-grekas ! The fix is working for me. The only problem is that i got a error for a security voter which could not call "isClassInstanceOf" anymore if i use your branch. Maybe the branch is from and older version of 2.8.x-dev ?

The Method should be located at Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\Voter\AbstractVoter

Ah ok. I see. The Method was removed 3 days ago! Missed that. In this case all is working right. :+1:
