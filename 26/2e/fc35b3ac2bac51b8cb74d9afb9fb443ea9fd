Rebased on 6.4, like https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/52746

As this PR only changes test files, I would vote to merge into `5.4`

Hi :wave: Should this be rebased to 5.4 again or rebase to 7.1? :slightly_smiling_face:

Let's rebase for 7.1 - this will still help spot issues on 5.4 when merging up changes from there.
