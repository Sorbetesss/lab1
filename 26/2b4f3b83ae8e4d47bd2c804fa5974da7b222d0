I think you can still create a simple test case that uses a "\n" and ensure the dumped result is OK (without trying to actually fit that with the case where it is required).

Some optimizations could be done, for example now string like `"\n\n\n"` dumped as `''."\n".''."\n".''."\n".''`. Is it reasonable to improve that case?

PHP 7 will concat at compile time, so no need IMHO.

So `var_export` does not play well with them ? what about `\r` then ?

`\r` is fine because the real issue is "explode" in "wrapServiceConditionals", which re-indents the code at `\n` points only.
