If you plan to do one PR per component, I'd prefer one PR to update them all instead if possible :)

Smaller PRs are mainly easier for me to handle at the moment. But if that’s jamming up the PR tracker, I’ll make larger ones. I doubt that one single gigantic PR for everything would be a good idea though.
