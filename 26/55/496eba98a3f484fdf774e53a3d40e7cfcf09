I'm +1 on the intend.
The UrlMatcher class also needs an update, and the corresponding tests I suppose.

Definitely 👍

Hey Javier, I like your proposal and in the same direction we might need to make some additional changes:

The phrase `... and you haven't configured any URLs.` could be incomplete now. What about finishing this statement with `... at root path.` or something similar?
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/ae252916108f3006ebdc26545f130442054f0eec/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/Resources/welcome.html.php#L79

According to your idea, this part should also be updated:
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/ae252916108f3006ebdc26545f130442054f0eec/src/Symfony/Component/Routing/Matcher/UrlMatcher.php#L79-L81

Related fixtures that require updating ([files](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/3.4/src/Symfony/Component/Routing/Tests/Fixtures/dumper)):
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/ae252916108f3006ebdc26545f130442054f0eec/src/Symfony/Component/Routing/Tests/Matcher/Dumper/PhpMatcherDumperTest.php#L423-L429

In the other hand, I have a concern now about the name/description of this exception, because it does not fit his new scenario, i.e. it'll be thrown even with routes configuration:
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/ae252916108f3006ebdc26545f130442054f0eec/src/Symfony/Component/Routing/Exception/NoConfigurationException.php#L14-L21
Do you think we can add another exception `NoRootConfiguration extends NoConfiguration` and throw it instead? In that case we might need deprecate the `NoConfiguration` class or use it only when `'' === $code`:
```php
$code .= "        if ('/' === \$pathinfo) {\n";
if ('' === $code) {
    $code .= "            throw new Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\NoConfigurationException();\n";
} else {
    $code .= "            throw new Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\NoRootConfigurationException();\n";
}
$code .= "        }\n";
```

> NoRootConfiguration extends NoConfiguration

I think it doesn't matter much, let's keep things simple IMHO

Status: needs work

So is there a quick fix?

I found this affects 4.0 too. (I just started following the getting started guide with 4.0.)

But I see that this is about the 3.4 branch and the other 4.0 pull requests and issues are closed... so I am wondering if this fix will apply to 4.x too?

@yceruto I'm sorry but I don't know how to make the changes you mentioned in `UrlMatcher.php` and `PhpMatcherDumperTest.php`. Can you please give me more details ... or maybe you can take over this PR? Thanks!

About the changes in `UrlMatcher` you need to remove this statement: `0 === count($this->routes) &&` from [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/ae252916108f3006ebdc26545f130442054f0eec/src/Symfony/Component/Routing/Matcher/UrlMatcher.php#L79), thus we're removing `"there are no routes defined"` constraint.

And the fixtures related to `PhpMatcherDumperTest.php` need to be re-dumped. See the diff [here](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/symfony/jobs/351259752#L3299-L3302).

@yceruto thanks for your great help! I made the change and tests are now green. Ready for review!
