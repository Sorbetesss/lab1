I like the idea. Maybe the format should be changed to`[Exception (404)]`, especially considering the long exception FQC names out there. However, I'm not sure if it's very clear that the number is the exception code in such case.

Thank you for your feedback @WouterJ, I did changes.
About long exception FQC names, maybe it's better for readability to show code in new line, like :

```
  [Exception]
  Code 404
  Not Found
```

No ?
