And again a DSN component would help us across the whole codebase

I know this was discussed quite often in the past. Anything changed your mind @nicolas-grekas ?

All this makes me think we need a working url parser... (a dsn component is another story.)
(and I don't know where I'd put this parser...)

To be reusable in a dedicated component ofc, but as this is util and no "domain", I don't know either ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but it sounds good üëç

Maybe this UrlParser could belong to HttpFoundation?

If this is something that could happen, I'll gladly implement this and leverage it in the numerous DSN parsing processes the codebase counts.

Rebased to 5.4 to make it a bug fix. I'll have a look at what can be done with some UrlParser/DsnParser to have a global logic over every DSN parsing
