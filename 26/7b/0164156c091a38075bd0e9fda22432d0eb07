you can add a test case in `AdapterTestCase` I guess

@nicolas-grekas added a case to the MemcachedAdapterTest

can we move it to the FilesystemAdapterTest ? I think it may have the issue also, and this would allow more people to actually run the test

wait, it really needs to be in AdapterTestCase, all of them need to run that test

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

it should also be in Simple\CacheTestCase, just for parity

Could even be part of https://github.com/php-cache/integration-tests, with even longer keys.
