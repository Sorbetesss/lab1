@Nyholm maybe we should remove `in` from the sentence?

Also, not sure about the token translation. Is `CSRF-symbol` the correct word here?

Thank you for the comments and feedback. I've updated the PR and changed the base.

"CSRF-symbolen" is way wrong. I could only come up with some other translations.

* "CSRF-token" but that is not really Swedish....
* "CSRF-elementet" (en: element) which is abstract but kind correct
* "CSRF-tecknen" (en: chars) which is more correct but also very confusing.
