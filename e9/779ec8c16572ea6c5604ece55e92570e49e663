Yes! Just tested it! I'm struggling with this since I've updated to 5.4. It's a quite rare situation, but in my case I'm having a very early RedirectResponse which crashes with a `Session has not been set`. So +1 from my side!

@jderusse Rebased more jobs are green. MacOS failure doesn't seems to be from my side
