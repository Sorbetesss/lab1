I think this PR does not qualify for being a bug fix but rather as a new feature.

Hi @fabpot , did you really think this PR should be qualify as a new feature ?

Since the behavior of `mirror` doesn't match what should be done at the origin (ie not to copy the target directory to the inside of itself).

Indeed, adding absolute path management to `mirror` might justify qualifying this PR as a new feature, but I think it was just a foregone departure.

I still think this is a new feature as the use case itself was not supported at all.

Ok So I'll rebase this branch on master and change de PR.
