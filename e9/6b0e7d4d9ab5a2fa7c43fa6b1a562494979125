this should not become a hard requirement, as only one of the transports of the bridge need it

I agree that making it a hard requirement is bad for one who only uses one of the other transports, maybe checking for the existence of the class first and a clear exception message is a better approach.

@jderusse if this is merged we should definitely add an issue about that and set the 6.0 milestone.

Anyway it worked like this before but is not really clear and that's a big feeling I have when working with bridges of mailer and/or notifier. My main goal is to make those bridges more "stable" from a usage perspective, they do not feel very "Symfony".

I am ok with closing this PR 👌🏻

adding a check on the extension in `SesTransportFactory` sounds good to me.
