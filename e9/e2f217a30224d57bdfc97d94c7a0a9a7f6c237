Thanks, LGTM. Should target master as it's a new feature.

@nicolas-grekas
Could you please explain a little, why you consider this a new feature? To me it is a bug or at least unintended behaviour. Furthermore this won't change any existing application out there, so i really don't get the point here.

This never worked as you said, so it wasn't supported. Adding support for something that wasn't possible before is almost the definition of a new feature to me.

So what's next?
@javiereguiluz marked the corresponding issue as bug. Shall i raise it with target `master` again or let it like that?

@sGy1980de I marked it as a bug because the issue description looked as a bug. But I could be wrong, so please don't think that it's definitive.

Hey guys - what about the bug vs. feature discussion on this? Is it discussed internally or are all following @nicolas-grekas opinion and i should raise this with target master again?

I tend to agree with @nicolas-grekas here.
