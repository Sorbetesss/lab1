Hey!

I like what you have done here.

To help keep things organized, we don't allow "Draft" pull requests. Could you please click the "ready for review" button or close this PR and open a new one when you are done?

Note that a pull request does not have to be "perfect" or "ready for merge" when you first open it. We just want it to be ready for a first review.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

I think this could even be considered as a bugfix.

Should I rebase on 4.4?

@fbourigault I don't think so, it looks like a new feature to me. We (or perhaps this is just me really) try to be much more conservative in merging non bugs in older branches. And reading the description/code, it does not looks like a bug to me.
