I'm not sure how HtmlSanitizer vs. DomCrawler correlates :thinking: nevertheless i think this makes the implementation more robust :+1:

@ro0NL they correlate because the current implementation is basically an opt-in based on the mere presence of the parser. Having html-sanitizer as a component requiring the parser would opt-in people unexpectedly. This pr solves this.

Can you target 6.1 now that exists?

@tgalopin Can you rebase this PR on 6.1? Is it ready to be merged then?
