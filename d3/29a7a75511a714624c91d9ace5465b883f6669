"Message Bus" for me üëç, the other looks like a chat icon.

"Messaging" ? i also suggested https://www.materialui.co/icon/message to @sroze

to me multiple baloons and thingies only clutter the icon.

to proposed message bus icon (small toolbar version) to me looks  like a routing thing, ie. http://c8.alamy.com/comp/HHAYN4/travel-tourism-distance-signposts-tour-route-direction-pole-data-HHAYN4.jpg

I quite like the "Message Bus" option, that shows the notion of routing (to/from adapters) behind the message bus(es).

Large version are nice, it's just the small version that might defeat its purpose, i.e. are hard to identify. IMHO icons like mail and security, thus more solid, are better candidates here.

"Message Bus" looks good to me.

The icon still looks weird at small size in the screenshot. Would it be possible to simplify the icon to optimize it for display at small size (the toolbar will always display it at 24px)
