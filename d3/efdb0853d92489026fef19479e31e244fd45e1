Hi @Olden, thank you for this much needed PR! :) Unfortunately there are a few other PRs in the merge queue that create a few conflicts with yours. Would you mind to rebase your PR on symfony/master once #6522 and #6573 are merged?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Olden at 2013-04-18T10:17:08Z

@bschussek no problem, I'll wait.

IMO renaming/removing even things like exceptions IS a BC-Break and should be mentioned in changelog/update documents.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both PRs referenced by @bschussek have been merged now. And Yes, this is a BC break.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bschussek at 2013-04-19T16:12:18Z

I think it is not necessary to rename any exception. Otherwise this PR should be fine in terms of BC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A bit later today I'll make rebase and update changelog file.

Thank you! I would appreciate if you could check the full component code again for "old-style" exceptions, because a couple of older PRs were merged recently. Their exception code possibly needs to be adapted too.

Rebased. @bschussek plz review this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Olden at 2013-04-19T19:46:54Z

Sorry for closing

by bschussek at 2013-04-19T21:16:44Z

Apart from my comments, this PR looks very good! Thank you! :)

For everybody confused by the diff view, the "renamed" exceptions are really just removed (because unused) exceptions and new exceptions that Git wrongly considers "renamed".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Olden at 2013-04-19T21:28:48Z

updated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Olden at 2013-04-19T21:30:27Z

@bschussek not at all. It's pleasure to me to be a part of great community :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by bschussek at 2013-04-19T21:31:22Z

Could you please squash the commits into a single commit?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Olden at 2013-04-19T21:36:17Z

done
