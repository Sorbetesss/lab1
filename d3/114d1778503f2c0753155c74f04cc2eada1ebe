Some other calls don't use `dump` as well like `$definition->getFactoryMethod()`. Shouldn't they be wrapped as well?

If I am not mistaken parameters aren't supported for the other options. Though wrapping all these places doesn't hurt at all. I'll update.

I thought it's about properly wrapping strings in quotation marks so they don't start with invalid `@` etc.

Exactly, though I think the places were I added this then too usually wouldn't contain forbidden characters anyway. But it shouldn't hurt to have this handling here.
