Apparently, xdebug is not available and our setup fails before running the tests for PHP nightly. The travis file should be fixed before we can merge this one.

XDebug is indeed not available on PHP 7 currently (it does not support PHP 7 yet).

The code removing the xdebug.ini config should check for ``nightly`` too

next steps (but probably in separate PRs though): debugging the issues on PHP 7 to know whether they are legitimate changes due to BC breaks in PHP 7 (the failure in the parsing of hexadecimal strings in Yaml is because of https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_hex_support_in_numeric_strings for instance) or whether they are highlighting bugs in PHP 7 (which should be reported to the PHP team).

Having the testsuite output for PHP 7 is great though.
