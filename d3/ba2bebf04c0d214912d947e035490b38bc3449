Wow, just turned off my pc so figured I'd approve these changes on my phone. But apparently it creates a commit for every change, if you want I can squash them tomorrow ðŸ˜‚

Wasn't sure about the formatting. Not too happy with how it looked but thought that'd be something for a different PR.

Got lots of questions like why the serializer context keys are mentioned in the docblock but not used etc. But yeah, for a new PR I suppose ðŸ˜…
