Impossible to resolve conflicts, because of 1st commit.

Just repushed to take comments into account:

1. Removed `FatalErrorHandlerInterface`, everything is done by `ErrorEnhancerInterface`.
2. Removed `FatalErrorInterface` and everything related that was only necessary to know if a class not found error was "fatal" or not. We handle it but end user just can't know if the error he gets was fatal or not (well not easily).
3. Removed `FatalErrorException` and `FatalThrowableError` in favor of `ErrorException`.
