I was wondering if this PR fixes an issue I'm seeing [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/33659#issuecomment-534273768). If so,   is there a workaround? I've disabled auto-setup, yet I'm still seeing tons and tons of queries. They're slamming our database.

EDIT: Yeah, it [did work](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/33659#issuecomment-534294681), after all.
