I've rewrite the first draft by inspiring from https://github.com/php-translation/extractor.

@nicolas-grekas It's quite ready for me. Just two questions:

- When will we deprecate `PhpExtractor` in favor of `PhpAstExtractor`?
- `PhpAstExtractor` is actually registered as service only if nikic/php-parser is installed, should we let it as it is?

(failures in CI are unrelated, including fabbot)

I rework the ConstraintVistor to cover more case (and I discover some that can not be covered, [see comment](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/46161/files#diff-0a9cc926e96f229280529914957f004a1337a054a51e26349294ce91fe428c26R71)).

Let me know if I miss something about those not covered cases.
