I don't think the failing test on Travis is related to this changeset in any way.

I don't think it's a good idea to allow this kind of global configuration. All instances will be impacted by this overriding.
Instead, what about turning these into regular properties?
This should be done on master as a new feature btw.

Fair enough! I'll be working on this.

@nicolas-grekas Does this look good to you? I left the static properties untouched (apart from their name) because they are referenced in `PhpDocExtractor`.

@nicolas-grekas @dunglas Is that better?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@nicolas-grekas There you go ;)

Once again, the CI results are beyond me.

@nicolas-grekas @dunglas Just fixed conflicts that occurred since the last merges on `master`. May I request a moment of your time to review this changeset for what I reckon will be the last time? :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by nicolas-grekas at 2017-05-22T08:29:58Z

this should be rebased on 3.4 in fact (I already changed the base branch)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by neemzy at 2017-05-22T09:20:50Z

@nicolas-grekas Alright, done!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

`PhpDocExtractor` tests should probably be updated too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by neemzy at 2017-05-29T08:19:40Z

@xabbuh Thanks for the feedback, I took it into account.
@nicolas-grekas @dunglas Anything left to do in your opinion?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by neemzy at 2017-05-31T07:30:19Z

@dunglas Is that OK for you? :)
