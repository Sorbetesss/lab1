For reference, disabling autoconfig for decorating services has been proposed by @stof in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/30391#issuecomment-467858531

The drawback was also described:
> If you have a memoizing decorator, it might make perfect sense to tag the decorator service as resettable (to clear its memoization), because that's a behavior that belongs to it.

As pointed out, all tags that describe behavior that belongs to the service itself should be preserved.
`container.service_subscriber` is one of them, but we could add `kernel.reset`, `kernel.event_subscriber` and others I suppose.

Now, I don't know how to make this generic...

I have reworked the patch to account for some more tags.
