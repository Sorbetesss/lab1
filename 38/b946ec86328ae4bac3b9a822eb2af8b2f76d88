Forgot to deprecate `$dnsMessage` option. Now updated. Should it be mentioned explicitly? In general it's only enabled thru `$checkDNS` so fine to me as is.

As people may forgot to not use the `dnsMessage` option when dropping `checkDNS` it might be good to deprecate it explicitly too.

Deprecation now moved to constraint constructor.
