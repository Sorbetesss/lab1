Okay, I found how to fix the broken tests. I now just have to write new tests for my change.

Btw @bschussek what do you think about this change ?

Does it work just like this? Can you add a test case? We also need to check the performance implications. I think they shouldn't be too bad though, because expanded choice fields are not usually used for long choice lists.

I've added a test.

Tests are broken but it does not seem to come from my changes.

@webmozart Looks like it's mergeable, no?
