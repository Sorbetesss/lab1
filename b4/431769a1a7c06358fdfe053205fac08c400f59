Note: adding this by default might break CI testing API endpoint responses, but I don't see much more reasons not to do so. So, better keep adding by default, or add a context option for this?

it may be better to make this behaviour opt-in

We don't guarantee that the output of the normalizers will never change. Especially, we don't guarantee that will not add fields. I'm in favor of adding it by default, but only if at least one parameter exists.
