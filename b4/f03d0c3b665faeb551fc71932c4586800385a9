I am not sure about this one because what if I want "at least 2" or "at most 3", etc. I think what you want to achieve is a composition of constraints (ref https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/35226), right?

When we need a composition of different constraints, shouldn't we create a custom constraint reusing core constraints "in context" instead?

What about maybe finding another name and add an option to choose the number of constraints that must be valid, so it is at least a bit dynamic?

Before increasing the complexity we should be sure there is a need for the feature.

When I started working on this one, I thought about creating a parameter for the number of "internal" constraints, that have to be satisfied. So initially, it was the `AtLeast` constraint. But with all the discussion around color validators, I decided, that a one-of-many variant should cover 99% of cases, in which anyone would ever wanted to use such a constraint. Nevertheless, making it the `AtLeast` constraint with default option set to one, isn't such a bad idea.

By the way, I will add more tests soon.

I don't think AtLeast > 1 serves any use case.
