@nicolas-grekas I've rebased the branch on 3.3 and all tests pass now. I think there were some failing tests in the 3.2 branch

@nicolas-grekas @stof tests are passing, is this okay to merge now?

@xabbuh the escaping code that this touches was added in v3.2 in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17662
