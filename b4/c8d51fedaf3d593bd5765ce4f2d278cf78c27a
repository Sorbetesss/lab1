Is it possible to write a test covering this, to prevent regressions ?

Yes off course @stof !

Can I use some fixed EHLO exchanges like the one above or should I connect to a real server?

@DjLeChuck We tend to avoid connecting to real servers to have fast and stable tests. So, replaying a real scenario is best.

I'm stuck, I don't know how to test without having to connect to a real server.

I don't know well PHPUnit and I lose myself in the mocking system. If someone wants to take the problem or help me, you're welcome!
