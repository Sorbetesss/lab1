@nicolas-grekas I reverted the milestone. We cannot introduce a new deprecation in 5.0.x

About the migration cost ... I would never change the `render()` method because *everybody* uses it ... but `renderView()` is much less popular (in my experience and from what I've seen out there: render() is used more than 100 times more often that renderView() ... but this is only my experience).

Seems about right. Not exactly a factor of 100 but here some numbers from my biggest Symfony 4.4 work project:

```
$ grep -r --include *Controller.php  'this->render(' src/ vendor/ | wc -l
180

$ grep -r --include *Controller.php  'this->renderView(' src/ vendor/ | wc -l
14

Another point. MVC division: Model, view, controller. Most programmers associate with such an approach that the controller generates a view, not a template.
