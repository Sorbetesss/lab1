But options shortcuts [are only one-letter](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html#using-command-options), aren't they ?

Usually, they should, but:

1. we do not enforce that anywhere
1. you can have more than one shortcut and all these shortcuts will be separated by the pipe character

Though the added test case was probably not the best. I updated it to use multiple shortcuts instead of one shortcut with multiple characters.

shouldn't this go in 2.6 ?

@stof In Symfony 2.6, this is handled in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.6/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Descriptor/TextDescriptor.php#L78-84. I think this case was forgotten when we updated to the docopt compatible output in Symfony 2.7.
