I just tested the case I described in the linked ticket, and it does behave like I wrote it so this change could technically break someone workflow.

@fancyweb the scenario you describe would apply to the cli but not to the web, right? Having a consistent behavior looks more important to me that preserving a non-consistent one to me. Makes sense?

It also applies to the web context but I guess it's very unlikely that someone relies on this behavior.
