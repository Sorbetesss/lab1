The `FormTypeValidatorExtensionTest` class depends on the `validator` property, which is now removed. I just need to figure out a way around this, will push an update later to fix it

@pierredup looks like this one just needs fixing one small comment. Would you be up for fixing it+rebasing/retargeting to 3.4?
