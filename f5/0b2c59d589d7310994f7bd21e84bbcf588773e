There are other occurrences of this pattern in `src/Symfony/Component/Intl/ResourceBundle/Reader/BinaryBundleReader.php` and `src/Symfony/Component/Intl/ResourceBundle/Transformer/Rule/LocaleBundleTransformationRule.php`

Also, it looks like that it returns `null`, not `false` in PHP.

Thanks, I meant to write ``false`` where I wrote `null` earlier.

From the documentation it seems it should return ```false```: http://www.php.net/manual/en/resourcebundle.create.php
```Returns ResourceBundle object or FALSE on error.```

If it does return false, then
```src/Symfony/Component/Intl/ResourceBundle/Reader/BinaryBundleReader.php``` and ```src/Symfony/Component/Intl/ResourceBundle/Transformer/Rule/LocaleBundleTransformationRule.php```
might not handle invalid bundles correctly, since ```false === null``` does not hold, and both of these error-check using ```if (null === $bundle) {```. I can't say for sure since I haven't tested it.

I've tested it and it does return `null`, not `false` (at least on PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.5 -- so it looks like the documentation is wrong).

Confirmed, I've made the changes and updated the other two classes.

Is there a reason to use `if (null === $bundle)` instead of `if (!$bundle)`?

We always do a strict comparisation of `null`.
