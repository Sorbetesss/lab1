Hey,

Since this is not a bug fix. Shouldn't this be applied against `master`? Or is the performance boost that big?

That's definitely for master

Not sure.. it must gain something i guess :) I thought it was nice little tweak for 2.7 as well.

Ie. imo its not a bug fix nor a new feature (new feature for the user that is). I guess the thing is we should be safe with refactoring.. as things can easily go [wrong](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/19848) :sweat_smile:

Ill target master :+1:
