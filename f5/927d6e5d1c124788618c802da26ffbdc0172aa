Hey!

I see that this is your first PR. That is great! Welcome!

Symfony has a [contribution guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/index.html) which I suggest you to read.

In short:
- Always add tests
- Keep backward compatibility (see https://symfony.com/bc).
- Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest maintained branch where they apply (see https://symfony.com/releases)
- Features and deprecations must be submitted against the 5.4 branch.

Review the GitHub status checks of your pull request and try to solve the reported issues. If some tests are failing, try to see if they are failing because of this change.

When two Symfony core team members approve this change, it will be merged and you will become an official Symfony contributor!
If this PR is merged in a lower version branch, it will be merged up to all maintained branches within a few days.

I am going to sit back now and wait for the reviews.

Cheers!

Carsonbot

It looks like you unchecked the "Allow edits from maintainer" box. That is fine, but please note that if you have multiple commits, you'll need to squash your commits into one before this can be merged. Or, you can check the "Allow edits from maintainers" box and the maintainer can squash for you.

Cheers!

Hi Core team - from what I can tell the failing tests are all failing on the 5.4 branch as well as here. So I assume I don't need to try to fix any more of these. Let me know if that's not correct. Would love to get this into the 5.4 release, thanks!

You don't need to fix tests you didn't break. ðŸ˜ƒ

@OskarStark  regarding the class names, it seems Fabbot is enforcing lowercase e.g. OhmysmtpTransportFactory over OhMySmtpTransportFactory

Which way should it be?

To me it should be the second one

Maybe it is because the folder is named lowercase?

You were right, took me a bit of wrestling with git to get it right but it's there now. Thanks!

`OhMySmtpTransportFactory` is the one to use to be consistent with the Symfony class naming convention.
