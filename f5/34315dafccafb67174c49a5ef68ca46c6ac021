Can you expand the fixtures to make use of such an annotation?

Are our tests broken because of this bug in phpdocumentor? If yes, we should merge (but a component's composer.json should be patched also, isn't it?), if not, it's not our job to provide an exclusion list to me.

@nicolas-grekas Having an annotation without parentheses is so common that we IMO should not fail on those classes.

then we need a test case that ensures we hit the issue also, as you asked for already btw :)
and src/Symfony/Component/PropertyInfo/composer.json needs the same patch

Any hints on which test class to add an `@api` anotation i.e.?

I added a simple testcase which definetly fails on 3.2.1. I required it localy and saw the test failing with the well know error.

`assertSame()` it is now.
