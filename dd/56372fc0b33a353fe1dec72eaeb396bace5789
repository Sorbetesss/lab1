It wasn't qualified as a bug in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/27429 though

Ohhh. So this was already fixed... but on master. I can see arguments both ways about a bug or a feature. This PR was motivated by me being confused by this yesterday... but it could also be “helped” on 3.4 and 4.1 by adding docs about activating it.
