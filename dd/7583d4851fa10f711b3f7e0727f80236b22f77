is this lazyloaded? :-1: This imo should just be documented http://www.craftitonline.com/2015/04/telling-symfony-to-use-cached-validation-from-doctrine-cache-bundle-provider/

@cordoval documenting is not enough imho. We need to provide an upgrade path.

:+1: We should just add this to the docs after merging.

Can we have the doc PR before merging?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by xabbuh at 2015-06-16T19:16:01Z

yes, we can (see symfony/symfony-docs#5409)

Any feedback on this one?

:+1: Does not hurt to have this extra service anyway. Having some other alternatives would be good as well but out of the scope of this PR.

Ok then. Let's merge :)
