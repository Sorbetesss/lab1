why is it opened against the master branch if you want it for 3.4 ? master is 4.0

Is it possible that a sub-request get created with all the attributes of its master request? In that case, using the request attributes as a cache would be wrong.

@fabpot The cache was introduced in 3.2. I've updated the PR.
