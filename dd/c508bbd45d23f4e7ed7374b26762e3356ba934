Doctrine is missing to document the possible exception: https://github.com/doctrine/common/blob/master/lib/Doctrine/Common/Persistence/Mapping/ClassMetadataFactory.php#L47

As it does not specify which exception can be thrown, it would make more sense the catch all exceptions (`\Exception`).

Catching all exceptions to ignore them could start a debugging nightmare...

The ORM MappingException case here can happen when using older versions of the ORM (in newer versions, the ORM exceptions extends from the Common one and so is catched already).

@Tobion an invalid mapping always throws a MappingException. Other exceptions could be thrown because of bugs, but these one should be kept uncaught here.

@stof I don't see that ORM MappingException extends the common one: https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/master/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Mapping/MappingException.php#L27
