Why don't you add `--limit=1` to stop the worker after one message?

@micheh that's a legitimate question. But to me, the PR still makes sense.

Using only `--limit=1` would still let the worker run indefinitely - until a message actually arrives. I want to let the worker stop immediately.

While I am fine with this PR, wouldn't time-limit=1 and limit=1 work for you?

The usage of time-limit=0 could be confusing?

Why not add an option --stop-immediately or sth more explanatory?

Not to an engineer? ;)
