Is it a correct way to pull request on pull request?

Since @fabpot PR has not merged into mainline, I send on PR on his PR branch.
If I send another PR on symfony,there will be two PR on same issus with share code
Here is a example of project doing this kind of stuff:
https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/pull/149
