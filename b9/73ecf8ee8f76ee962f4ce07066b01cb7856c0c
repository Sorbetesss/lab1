It was briefly talked about in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/24182#discussion_r138551329
Looking at the proposed diff, I'm personally not favorable to merging this.
But I won't spend more time on CS things so I'll let others do however they want :)

I don't like it either.
Do we want to be PSR-2 compliant (it does not appear in the repository tags)? If yes [then it's a must](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/#52-switch-case).

http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html :
> Symfony follows the standards defined in the PSR-0, PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR-4 documents.

it's not big cost to pay for not violating PSR
