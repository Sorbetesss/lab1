what does it do exactly ?

Screaming is a feature that allows logging of @-silenced PHP errors. (e.g. `@unlink($file)`)
In dev mode, screaming is enabled for all PHP error levels.
But in the logs we don't want a silenced PHP warning to come up as LogLevel::WARNING.
We'd prefer having to add `-vv` to app/console to see them

yeah, looks good to me. :+1:

Btw, it would be great to fix the deps=low tests
