Basically, if this makes sense, I will:

A) Complete this for Messenger with tests
B) Propose the DoctrineBundle PR
C) (At least) make a list of the other areas in the system that need this type of thing

Should we deprecate schema filters from https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/pull/1037 PR if current will be merged?

@Koc At least for Messenger & Cache, definitely. In fact, I'd argue we should we remove them: this feature will replace them

For Lock & PdoSessionStorage, they will probably need to stay, as this PR doesn't fix those situations - at least not all the way.

This is ready - test failures look unrelated.

I'm super happy with the Messenger & Cache integration and very dissatisfied with the Lock & Session integration. My instinct is that we need to save a proper Lock & Session solution for later.

Cheers!
